    "output": "The question is relatively broad and one should take into account that the brain not only consists of neurons, but also glial cells (supportive cells) and pre-mitotic neuronal stem cells. Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (Klämbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration).",

It uses a RISC design, that is its elementary commands are regularly encoded and there are only few of them in order to keep the wires simple.\nIt was mentioned that CISC follows a different philosophy. I looked briefly at the x86 instruction set and was shocked. I can not image how anyone would want to build a processor that uses so complex a command set!\nSo I figure there have to be good arguments why large portions of the processor market use CISC architectures. What are they? ",
    "input": "",
    "output": "There is a general historical trend.\nIn the olden days, memories were small, and so programs were perforce small. Also, compilers were not very smart, and many programs were written in assembler, so it was considered a good thing to be able to write a program using few instructions. Instruction pipelines were simple, and processors grabbed one instruction at a time to execute it. The machinery inside the processor was quite complex anyway; decoding instructions was not felt to be much of a burden. \nIn the 1970s, CPU and compiler designers realized that having such complex instructions was not so helpful after all. It was difficult to design processors in which those instructions were really efficient, and it was difficult to design compilers that really took advantage of these instructions. Chip area and compiler complexity was better spent on more generic pursuits such as more general-purpose registers. The Wikipedia article on RISC explains this in more detail.\nMIPS is the ultimate RISC architecture, which is why it's taught so often.\nThe x86 family is a bit different. It was originally a CISC architecture meant for systems with very small memory (no room for large instructions), and has undergone many successive versions. Today's x86 instruction set is not only complicated because it's CISC, but because it's really a 8088 with a 80386 with a Pentium possibly with an x86_64 processor.\nIn today's world, RISC and CISC are no longer the black-and-white distinction they might have been once. Most CPU architectures have evolved to different shades of grey.\nOn the RISC side, some modern MIPS variants have added multiplication and division instructions, with a non-uniform encoding. ARM processors have become more complex: many of them have a 16-bit instruction set called Thumb in addition to the “original” 32-bit instructions, not to mention Jazelle to execute JVM instructions on the CPU. Modern ARM processors also have SIMD instructions for multimedia applications: some complex instructions do pay after all.\nOn the CISC side, all recent processors are to some extent RISC inside. They have microcode to define all these complex macro instructions. The sheer complexity of the processor makes the design of each model take several years, even with a RISC design, what with the large number of components, with pipelining and predictive execution and whatnot.\nSo why do the fastest processors remain CISC outside? Part of it, in the case of the x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) family, is historical compatibility. But that's not the whole of it. In the early 2000s, Intel tried pushing the Itanium architecture. Itanium is an extreme case of complex instructions (not really CISC, though: its design has been dubbed EPIC). It even does away with the old-fashioned idea of executing instructions in sequence: all instructions are executed in parallel until the next barrier. One of the reasons Itanium didn't take is that nobody, whether at Intel or elsewhere, could write a decent compiler for it. Now a good old mostly-sequential processor like x86_64, that's something we understand.",

But GTOs are more popular because they are easier to calculate with. GTOs decay with $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, so its adequate to sometimes add diffuse functions to the GTO basis set to compensate for gaussian decay behaviour.\nAlso, exact hydrogen wavefunctions decay exponentially, so the motivation for STOs.\nI understand that the only boundary requirement for solving the Schrödinger equation for atoms and molecules in free space is that the wavefunction goes zero as $r \\to \\infty$, but there are no a priori requirements for the way it decays as it does so.\nMy question is: do we have theoretical (ab initio) and/or experimental reasons to believe that all atomic and molecular wavefunctions decay like $e^{-\\alpha r}$ as $r \\to \\infty$.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "I'll answer this question from the theoretical side. The exponential behavior follows simply from the Schrödinger equation. Consider the one-electron Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}))\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon < 0\n$$\nAt spatial points that are very far away from the nucleus, $V(\\mathbf{r})\\approx 0$, so that the asymptotic solution is given by\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon < 0\n$$\nThis differential equation has basic solutions of the form\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nfor some unit vector $\\mathbf{k}$. The real asymptotic behavior of $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is thus a linear combination of these basic solutions. The linear combination may bring a polynomial prefactor to the exponential, but will never alter the exponent. Thus we have not only proved the exponential behavior, but also derived the correct exponent $\\alpha = \\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}$. For a multi-electronic, non-interacting system, the overall decay rate is governed by the slowest decaying orbital, i.e. the HOMO.\nOf course, the real wavefunction can only be described by a multi-electron Schrödinger equation. But we can work on the equivalent Kohn-Sham system and show that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays at a rate given by the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. By Janak's theorem, the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy is just the negative of the ionization potential of the exact system. To see this, consider a huge ensemble of $N$ identical, non-interacting molecules. If we remove one electron from the ensemble and let the hole delocalize evenly between all the molecules, then as $N\\to +\\infty$, the electron removal has a negligible impact on the electron density of any molecule (and therefore the Kohn-Sham potential of each molecule). Therefore under the Kohn-Sham framework we see that removing such an electron costs an energy of $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ (it does not matter whether the HOMO refers to that of the ensemble or that of a molecule, since their orbital energies are equal), since the electron is taken from an energy level whose energy is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the Hamiltonian is not changed in this process. On the other hand, from the perspective of the real system it is clear that the energy cost is equal to the first ionization energy of one of the molecules, $I$. Therefore we have $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = -I$, which means that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays like (again up to a possible polynomial prefactor; the precise determination of this polynomial prefactor is a much more difficult question)\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{2I}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nAlthough the Kohn-Sham wavefunction is fictional, its density is equal to the true multielectronic density, and in order for the true density to have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham density, the true wavefunction must have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham wavefunction.

First, many experts believe that such a border wall will not work.  Second, there is real concern that the Administration, put simply, has no plan to build the border wall.  For example, the Administration has not detailed how to 1) use eminent domain and other procedures to acquire land from private landowners and Native American tribes, 2) design the wall, 3) locate the wall, 4) construct the wall, and 5) require Mexico to pay for the wall given the President’s clear and repeated promises that he would force Mexico to do so. Finally, there are objections to the construction of a wall from Democratic and Republican members of Congress that represent border states.

    "input": "",
    "output": "DOOM itself doesn’t do anything special to benefit from PCI graphics cards. It runs faster with PCI graphics cards (and VLB, AGP, and PCI Express cards) than with ISA graphics cards because the supporting bus is faster, so reads from and writes to video memory take less time.\nPCI goes to great lengths to preserve backwards compatibility with ISA-based VGA, providing support for “VGA compatible” adapters so that they can appear in memory at the same locations and use the same I/O ports as ISA VGA cards. So accesses to the VGA registers and to the VGA buffer (at 0xA0000) go directly to the main PCI VGA compatible adapter in the system, with no change required in the operating system or programs running on it. (This is the reason why there’s a specific “VGA compatible controller” device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.)\nA faster bus and/or faster video memory immediately leads to higher performance in video-intensive programs because software doesn’t need to be careful about how it accesses video memory (except on CGA, and on all platforms with vertical blank synchronisation if it cares about tearing). So ```REP MOVSW``` or ```REP MOVSD``` with no waiting in software, once the program decides to write a frame, is perfectly fine, and will go faster and faster as the underlying hardware improves. On platforms where this can’t work in hardware (e.g. on an 8088 with a VGA card), the hardware takes care of specifics — for example on an 8088 the bus unit will split up 16-bit accesses.\nYour question is specific to DOOM but other DOS games are in a similar situation. Later games tended to rely on VBE (often using UniVBE) to access video modes beyond those provided by VGA, but they mostly didn’t use anything beyond video-mode setup and framebuffer configuration (see also Were any DOS games (or software) known to use VBE/AF?), so improved video speed came mostly from bus speed increases, faster video memory, and speed increases in the cards themselves (which was already a factor in the ISA era, compare most Trident cards to Tseng cards for example).\nFor an excellent explanation of the intricacies of VGA programming and its memory layout, see Fabien Sanglard’s Game Engine Black Book series. The DOOM update loop is shown on page 185 of the DOOM book; it doesn’t use any assembly language (unlike the renderer, see pp. 290 and following), but it does have one perhaps surprising feature given the 32-bit nature of the code: VGA updates are done 16 bits at a time. Section 2.3 of the same book, pp. 59 and following, describes some of the improvements to VGA adapters around the time DOOM was released, in particular the switch to the VESA Local Bus on 486s. The benchmark table on page 287 shows the importance of the bus.",

In neither case are we executing arbitrary text, so it doesn't have an inherent \"but you can type ```'filename ; rm -rf /'```\" problem, and if the file name can be corrupted, using ```subprocess.call``` gives us little additional protection.\n* Error handling: It doesn't actually give us any more error detection, we're still depending on the ```retcode``` in either case; but the behavior to explicitly raise an exception in the case of an error will certainly help you notice if there is a failure (though in some scenarios, a traceback might not at all be more helpful than simply ignoring the error).\n* Spawns a (non-blocking) subprocess: We don't need to wait for the child process, since we're by problem statement starting a separate process.\n\nTo the objection \"But ```subprocess``` is preferred.\"  However, ```os.system()``` is not deprecated, and it's in some sense the simplest tool for this particular job. Conclusion: using ```os.system()``` is therefore also a correct answer.\nA marked disadvantage is that the Windows ```start``` command requires you to pass in ```shell=True``` which negates most of the benefits of using ```subprocess```.\n",

    "output": "Trade surplus/deficit\nDevaluing one's currency means mostly one thing: It becomes more expensive to import products from abroad, while one's own products become comparably cheaper to buy on the world market. That means a country which exports lots of goods wants to devalue their currency while a country which imports lots of goods does not.\nIn 2016, Turkey imported goods worth US $186 billion and exported goods worth US $156 billion. That means they had a trade deficit of 19%.\nHowever, China only imported goods worth US $1.23 trillion and exported goods worth US $2.27 trillion in 2016. That means they had a trade surplus of 84%.\nWhich is why China wants to devalue their currency while Turkey does not.\nDebt management\nAnother reason to devalue one's currency is that it reduces any debts denoted in that currency. If a country has a problem of too much public and private debt, then an easy way to get rid of it is to cause a hyperinflation. \nChina happens to have a debt-to-gdp ratio of 47.6% while Turkey only has one of 28.3%. When you look at the private debt (debt of private citizens and companies in the country), you see the same picture. Private debit in Turkey was 170% of GDP, while China's is rumored to be over 300%.\nWhich is why reducing debt through causing inflation seems more attractive to China than to Turkey.\nForeign investor relations\nSo why don't all countries get rid of their debt by adding a few zeroes to their bank notes? Because inflating your currency is a surefire way to drive away any foreign investors. Nobody will invest money into your country when that money might be worth nothing in a few years. Investors want stable currencies. Again, we observe the same difference in motivation between Turkey and China here. Turkey is actively inviting foreign investors, but China is quite reluctant to allow foreign economic influence in their country.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "This is a great question, with no one right answer.\nThe strength of a patent comes from the ability to enforce it. If the patent owner cannot enforce it for whatever reason (such as a lack of funding), the patent is effectively toothless.\nBut your competitors will likely not know that. They may therefore be dissuaded from infringing simply by the existence of a patent and the assumption that you would sue. Such a chilling effect on competition may be valuable to you.\nIn addition, if there is infringement, you may be able to get a licensing agreement without the need for litigation. This can be a very lucrative business model, and so may justify the cost of patenting.\nAnd if litigation seems likely, there is a nascent field of litigation funding. While your funders will take quite a great deal of the damages, you may at least get something out of the end of it.\nFinally, even if you can't sue, someone else could. You might therefore get quite some value from selling it off at some point. There are a number of tech businesses where most of their value comes from their IP portfolio.\nOn the whole therefore it depends how you see yourself proceeding. If you're unsure, it may pay to err on the side of patenting: once you disclose or use your invention publicly, you're generally barred from patenting it later (but for a short grace period in some countries), whereas it's easy to abandon a patent (or application) later down the track if you wish.",

This casting operation is normally automatic, since it's always safe and can be implemented directly by the compiler.

This casting operation creates execution overhead, since Java requires that the cast be checked at runtime to make sure that it's valid.

Instant replay would limit their authority.\n* Football is global. Many places do not have access to the technology necessary to implement instant replay.\n* Football is a fast-paced game with few opportunities for stoppage. Instant replay would unnecessarily slow the pace.\n\nIn 2008, FiFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\n  \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision – a man, not a machine.\"\n\nBlatter and others at FIFA have repeatedly argued against using instant replay. But lately, FIFA has begun to come around on the idea. At FIFA's Congress in São Paulo prior to the 2014 World Cup, Blatter proposed allowing managers 2 challenges per game, much like the NFL handles challenges today.\nAlthough it's not quite \"instant replay,\" in 2012 FIFA approved two different goal-line technologies to improve referee accuracy: \"Hawk-Eye\" -- which uses visual triangulation to determine ball location -- and \"GoalRef\" -- which uses a microchip in the ball and magnetic sensors within goalposts. (Many say FIFA approved the technologies in response to Frank Lampard's snubbed \"goal\" against Germany in the 2010 World Cup.) In 2013, FIFA announced it would use GoalControl, a German competitor to Hawk-Eye, at the Confederations Cup, basically a rehearsal for the World Cup. After a successful run at that tournament, FIFA announced it would implement GoalControl at the 2014 World Cup. The Guardian provides a pretty helpful FAQ on the technology.\nFIFA may choose to implement further changes to approved goal-line technology and referee rules when it meets again after the World Cup.",

Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of monophyletic groups (clades). It's like a set of venn diagrams, where all organisms fall into a giant circle and then successively smaller circles classify more and more specific groups.\n\nThe clade Reptilia includes snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and lots of extinct groups, including dinosaurs. So all dinosaurs are reptiles. The clade Dinosauria includes all the extinct dinosaurs (Stegosaurus, Triceratops, sauropods, etc.), including theropod dinosaurs, which include well known dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus. Based on a mountain on anatomical evidence, including lots of transitional fossils, living birds are a sub-group of theropod dinosaurs.\n\nSo all birds (Aves) are theropod dinosaurs (Dinosauria: Theropoda). All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles. They are just more closely related to dinosaurs than to other reptiles.\nThe tricky part is that most people have an intuitive idea of what \"reptiles\" and \"dinosaurs\" are. To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don't mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs and reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.\n\nA few words about pterosaurs\nAlong with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another. So pterosaurs are flying reptiles but not flying dinosaurs.\nThese images might help you understand the above explanation.",

    "output": "The different types of cars are an instance of a general problem that surfaces over and over again in data modeling.  It is called \"generalization/specialization\" in ER modeling, and \"superclass/subclass\" in object modeling.  \nAn object modeler uses the inheritance features built into the object model to solve the problem quite easily.  The subclasses simply extend the superclass.\nThe relational modeler is faced with a problem.  how to design the tables so as to emulate the benefits that one would get from inheritance?  \nThe simplest technique is called single table inheritance.  Data about all types of cars are grouped into a single table for cars.  There is a column, car_type, that groups together all the cars of a single type.  No car can belong to more than one type.  If a column is irrelevant to, say, electric cars,  it will be left NULL in the rows that pertain to electric cars.\nThis simple solution works well for the smaller and simpler cases.  The presence of a lot of NULLs adds a tiny bit to storage overhead, and a little bit to retrieval overhead.  The developer may have to learn SQL three-valued logic if boolean tests are done on nullable columns.  This can be baffling at first, but one gets used to it.\nThere is another technique, called class table inheritance.  In this design, there are separate tables for gas_car, electric_car, and hybrid_car, in addition to a combined table, car, for all of them.  When you want all of the data about a specific kind of car, you join the car table with the appropriate specialized table.  There are fewer NULLs in this design, but you do more joining.  This technique works better in the larger and more complex cases.\nThere is a third technique called shared primary key.  This technique is often used in conjunction with class table inheritance.  The specialized tables for the subclasses have, as their primary key, a copy of the primary key of the corresponding entry in the car table.  This id column can  be declared to be both the primary key and a foreign key.\nThis involves a little extra programming when new cars are to be added, but it makes the joins simple, easy, and fast.\nSuperclasses and subclasses happen all the time in the real world.  Don't be afraid.  But do test your initial design for performance. If your first attempt is simple and sound, you'll be able to tweak it to speed it up.",

Thomas dissents on the grounds that the President &quot;may be entitled to relief against [a subpoena's] enforcement&quot; based on his special status as president. Thomas argues (agreeing with the president) that the case should be vacated and returned to the lower court, so that the President can argue that his duties to the nation take up all of his time and attention and he thus deserves relief from the subpoena.\nJustice Alito makes a stronger dissent. While he agrees that a sitting President is not absolutely immune from a state subpoena, he argues that such a subpoena should not be enforced unless it meets a stringent legal test, such that:\n\n* It does not interfere with the President's execution of his duties of office, and\n* It carries a weight of urgency — e.g., subpoenaing information related to suspected treason — as a guarantee it is not merely issued to harass.\n\nIn the absence of those conditions, in Alito's opinion, the President is only subject to the constitutional process of impeachment and trial in Congress.\nSo no, neither dissenting Justice suggests that the President is absolutely immune from this kind of subpoena. Instead, they are concerned that the issuance of such subpoenas might negatively impact on the President's ability to perform the duties of the office, and argue that the President might legitimately be granted varying degrees of relief from such legal actions at a court's discretion.",

The main objection was to the boardgame we were publishing, The Battle of Five Armies. The author of that game had given us a letter from his attorney claiming the work was grandfathered because it was published after the copyrights for JRRT's works had lapsed and before any renewals were made. The action also demanded we remove balrog, dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg from the D&D game. Although only balrog and warg were unique names we agreed to hobbit as well, kept the rest, of course. The boardgame was dumped, and thus the suit was settled out of court at that.\n\nHalflings were originally called &quot;hobbits&quot; in the Dungeons & Dragons box set first released in 1974. Later printings changed this to &quot;halfling&quot;.\nAccording to The Acaeum, this change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition. However, Tim Kask has said that box sets were generally thrown together with whichever printings of the books were on hand, so the distinctions between printings are inexact. The Acaeum notes at least one box set shipped having the revised booklets but no Original Collector's Edition mark.\nDue to an oversight, a single reference to &quot;hobbit&quot; remained on page 6 of Men & Magic, which was fixed in the 2013 Deluxe reprint and PDF copies.\nAccording to Wikipedia, J.R.R. Tolkien sold the film, stage, and merchandising rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968, who sold them in turn to Saul Zaentz in 1976.

    "input": "",
    "output": "Certainly there is a correlation between muscle mass and strength, but there is more to the story. Two reasons why muscle mass and strength may not be completely congruous are:\n\n* Muscle fiber density\n* Muscle utilization\n\nDensity:\nYour muscles are composed of four different types of fibers (slow-twitch, and three forms of fast-twitch). These fibers have different profiles in terms of force applied and recovery time. Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. \nExtra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle. This glycogen can be a ready source of energy for the muscles, but isn't going to increase their maximum theoretical force for a single heavy lift (per Olympic competition) where endurance through a long set isn't at issue.\nUtilization:\nThe average person is able to utilize 20-30% of their total theoretical muscle strength when trying their hardest. (Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. \n\nCan a buff guy be weak? \nWell, it depends on your definition of buff. A cut guy can be weak (compared to a strength athlete), because muscle definition is more about having low body fat covering the muscle than it is about having large muscles. \nA bodybuilder with decent volume won't be able to lift as much as a comparable powerlifter because he/she doesn't train for strength per se. It seems worth noting that Olympic/power lifters also want to minimize their size (except for the heavyweights) because it affects their weight class in competition, so there is an added incentive to train for neural utilization over additional muscle mass.",

When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions.",

They are often distinguished by having distinct personalities and dialog, whereas a \"\"Player Character\"\" is meant as more of an extension of the player themselves. Think of the companion party members in the Mass Effect series for an example.\n\nA Bot, by contrast, is essentially a player of the game controlled by a computer. This can be populated within a single instance, as a feature in some games (i.e. AI opponents in a normally multiplayer game), or, in some cases, actually represents a separate instance of the application running on a networked computer and being controlled by some manner of AI script (as is common in many MMO's, much to the dismay of the communities playing the game).

Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1/31,560 (SD=15) or 1/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1/161 would drop to about 1/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```. However, both these factors are not in any way close to the US/Chinese population ratio of about 1/4.375, so the original conclusion still holds.",

With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits.

If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. It is said to help improve the crema.\nOne thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available.

This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard. A handheld-sized efficient electrical near point light source with 27000W input, driven constantly, would first severely damage your eyes and then self destroy violently (think of a welding arc - dangerously bright, and it melts metal).",

    "output": "The situation you're describing is tough. Layoffs have a very real impact on both the individuals that are let go and those that remain. I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n",

As for the correlation, it describes the similarities between to signals. But how does convolution and correlation effect on a image and how different are they in terms of effects?\nThanks",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Convolution is correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. This makes no difference, if the filter is symmetric, like a Gaussian, or a Laplacian.  But it makes a whole lot of difference, when the filter is not symmetric, like a derivative.  \nThe reason we need convolution is that it is associative, while correlation, in general, is not. To see why this is true, remember that convolution is multiplication in the frequency domain, which is obviously associative. On the other hand, correlation in the frequency domain is multiplication by the complex conjugate, which is not associative.\nThe associativity of convolution is what allows you to \"pre-convolve\" the filters, so that you only need to convolve the image with a single filter. For example, let's say you have an image $f$, which you need to convolve with $g$ and then with $h$.  $f * g * h = f * (g * h)$. That means you can convolve $g$ and $h$ first into a single filter, and then convolve $f$ with it. This is useful, if you need to convolve many images with $g$ and $h$. You can pre-compute $k = g * h$, and then reuse $k$ multple times.\nSo if you are doing template matching, i. e. looking for a single template, correlation is sufficient. But if you need to use multiple filters in succession, and you need to perform this operation on multiple images, it makes sense to convolve the multiple filters into a single filter ahead of time.",

By changing one's embouchure, those notes start at a fundamental, then gradually go up in harmonics. The first notes (in key C) would be C, G, C, E, G.Those notes are the ones we hear when a bugle is played - Reveille, Last Post, etc. Bugles only play the harmonic series of notes, and can't play the ones in between. Read on.\nOn a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones.\nLet's take the first G note. To get F♯, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E♭, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C♯, press all three.\nThat's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch. Notice that between G and the next C, there are only two tones.\nSo at this point, not so many notes are needed, so the valve pressing is more simple. Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed.\nNow, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide. At various places along that slide, there are all the notes found similarly to pressing valves. There's also loads of extra notes that are going to be out of tune!",

    "input": "",
    "output": "There are two somewhat orthogonal concepts in backdooring encryption algorithms:\n\n* The backdoor can be explicit or implicit. An explicit backdoor is one that everybody knows it is there. An implicit backdoor strives at remaining undetected by the algorithm owners. Of course, when there is an explicit backdoor, people tend to avoid the algorithm altogether, so explicit backdoors may hope to work only in the presence of a legal framework that forces implementers to use the backdoored system.\nAn example of an explicit backdoor is the Clipper chip (which was ultimately abandoned). The backdoor is not really in the algorithm, more in the assembly of algorithms into a protocol, and technically it was an automatic key escrowing method. For an implicit backdoor, see the Dual EC DRBG as a famous example: it worked only as long as nobody was aware that it was backdoored.\n* The backdoor's security may be quantifiable, or not. In the case of Dual EC DRBG, the mechanism uses well-trodden mathematical paths: the NSA knew that exploiting the backdoor required knowledge of an internal secret key, based on discrete logarithm (on elliptic curves).\nA non-quantifiable security is what happens when you try to push, for instance, a voluntarily flawed algorithm, or one for which you know of a cryptanalytic method that you did not publish. This is a very dangerous game for a spy agency, because you cannot really know whether third parties could find the flaw or not. Such backdooring tends to backfire in the long term.\nInterestingly, the NSA tends not to use non-quantifiable backdoors. A good example is DES. At the time it was designed, the NSA believed that it could tackle an upfront 256 exhaustive search, and that nobody else (in particular the Soviets) had the technology and budget for that. The NSA also knew of a novel cryptanalytic method (differential cryptanalysis). So when the NSA intervened in the design of DES, it insisted on shortening the key from 64 to 56 bits (that's addition of a quantifiable backdoor, and it was rather obvious, so quasi-explicit), and also on strengthening the design against differential cryptanalysis. This is a good example about how NSA consciously refrained from a non-quantifiable backdoor. There is only one thing that spy agencies fear more than not being able to spy: it is the idea that other competing spy agencies may also spy.\n\nSo a real, good backdoor is one that uses maths to offer quantifiable security against unauthorized usage of the backdoor. It is extremely difficult to have quantifiable security without making the backdoor explicit. The \"best in class\" in that area is Dual EC DRBG, and even before the Snowden business, cryptographers were already finding it weird and strongly suspected foul play (see the analyses back in 2007, 6 years before Snowden).",

Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.

Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```/bin/echo```.\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```/bin/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```/usr/bin/printf``` also exists.\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```/bin/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```/bin/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```/bin/echo``` as well--assuming ```/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\n```$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is /bin/echo\n```",

    "output": "As you must already be aware by now there are no classes in JavaScript. Instead functions in JavaScript may be made to behave like constructors by preceding a function call with the ```new``` keyword. This is known as the constructor pattern.\nIn JavaScript everything is an object except for the primitive data types (boolean, number and string), and ```undefined```. On the other hand ```null``` is actually an object reference even though you may at first believe otherwise. This is the reason ```typeof null``` returns ```&quot;object&quot;```.\nFunctions in JavaScript are similar to functables in Lua (i.e. they are callable objects). Hence a function can be used in place of an object. Similarly arrays are also objects in JavaScript. On the other hand objects can be thought of as associative arrays.\nThe most important point however is that there are no classes in JavaScript because JavaScript is a prototypal object oriented language. This means that objects in JavaScript directly inherit from other objects. Hence we don't need classes. All we need is a way to create and extend objects.\n",

You can see that $f \\in \\Omega(g)$ is equivalent to $g \\in \\cal{O}(f)$.\n$f \\in \\Theta(g)$ means that $f$ grows about as fast as $g$; formally $f \\in \\cal{O}(g) \\cap \\Omega(g)$. $f \\sim g$ (asymptotic equality) is its stronger form.

It is important to be very aware of this and their precise definitions -- which can differ depending on who is talking -- when doing \"arithmetics\" with them. \nWhen proving things, take care to work with your precise definition. There are many definitions for Landau symbols around (all with the same basic intuition), some of which are equivalent on some sets on functions but not on others.\n\nIf you are interested in using Landau notation in a rigorous and sound manner, you may be interested in a work by Rutanen et al..

If you'd send Gaia towards Neptune (besides the fact that no one has ever sent an orbiter, to say nothing of a L2 mission that far out) that has a period of 168 years, then after 5 years you'd get... 5/168 th of one paralactic measurement.\nIt simply couldn't achieve its science goals if put around the L2 behind Neptune. Also no one on this planet has any experience in putting something into a outer system L2 point. This is different than putting it into Earth's L2, because reaching the L2 around one of the giants has vast and very precise $\\Delta v$ requirements. This would be a massive technological leap, and things don't work that way in space. Small, incremental technological steps are required in an anyways unfriendly environment, to make sure everything works properly and no millions of dollars have been wasted.\nCompare that to Gaia's predecessor, the Hipparcos satellite, which was parked in geostationary orbit.\nNow you could still say, why not use Jupiter hypothetically anyways. Well, the orbital period there is still 11 years, and Jupiter's L2 still suffers from the intense radiation environment that is provided by Jupiter's magnetosphere.

The technical environment in which many people are now writing software differs from the historical software development environment (of monolithic applications performing batch computations) in two key ways:\n\n* Many-core machines are now common. We can no longer expect clock speeds or transistor densities to increase by orders of magnitude. The price of computation will continue to fall, but it will fall because of lots of parallelism. We're going to have to find a way to take advantage of that power.\n* Computers are now heavily networked and modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources.\n\nFrom a computational standpoint, these two factors essentially boil down to the same core idea: information increasingly will be available in an asynchronous fashion. Whether the information you need is being computed on another chip in your machine or on a chip halfway around the world doesn't really matter. Either way, your processor is sitting there burning billions of cycles a second waiting for information when it could be doing useful work. \nSo what matters now, and what will matter even more in the future, is not multithreading per se, but rather, dealing with asynchrony. Multithreading is just one way to do that -- a complicated, error-prone way that is only going to get more complicated and more error-prone as weak-memory-model chips become more widely used. \nThe challenge for tools vendors is to come up with some way better than multithreading for our customers to deal with the asynchronous infrastructure they'll be using in the future.",

This is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation. One common example is the Lucida cut sometimes referred to as the Tiffany cut.\nDiamonds can also be manufactured. The same carbon structure can be grown in a lab. These stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities. Most manufactured diamonds are used industrially, but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for gemstone quality synthetic diamonds. They sell at a decent discount, so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute.

    "input": "",
    "output": "There are a few reasons why immersion helps you learn a language without you actively trying:\n* You encounter the language more often.  When you are immersed in a language, you don't go to class and do homework for a few hours a week, but rather use the language the entire day.  You depend on the language to survive—to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to. It becomes a way of life.\n* You learn the language in more than one way.  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own. This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.\n* You begin to think in the language. If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate. Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say \"excuse me\" or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step. This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.\n* Culture reinforces language learning. When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language. Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning. This will expand your ability to communicate in that language.",

(The problem also had an important practical application in 18th century, namely to navigation. If you can predict the motion of the Moon for few years ahead with sufficient accuracy, you can determine longitude at sea without a chronometer, just by observing Moon's position with respect to the stars).\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, an exact mathematical formulation of what was desired was achieved: to express the motions of the bodies in the form of convergent series of functions of time, valid for all times. Few people remember nowadays that in this precise form the problem was actually solved (by Sundman, at the very end of the 19th century). This solution can be found in Siegel's book on celestial mechanics.\n\nBut by that time it was already understood that this solution was useless for practical purposes, namely for prediction of the Moon's motion over long time periods.

So the broadcast signal is modulated using a 'Gold Code' (in the case of the oldest public GPS signal) where part of the signal transmitted by the satellite is already known by the receiver - the GPS receiver can pick out the signal despite how faint it is, by tracking the cross-correlation between the received and expected signals.\nThis also means multiple satellites can transmit their signals at the same frequency - so long as they use different gold codes, the receiver can track both signals independently.\nNewer GNSS signals replace gold codes with newer techniques - like 'multiplexed binary offset carriers' - which perform better, but do basically the same thing.",

A rabbit can fill up on it (because of the bulk), but still need food because they didn't get enough calories, vitamins, minerals, etc.\nIf you look at the USDA's webpage on iceberg lettuce. You'll notice that water makes up just about 95% of the nutrients, leaving 5% to be divided up between every other nutrient. Protein is a little less than 1%, Carbohydrates less than 3%, and sugars less than 2%.\nMost importantly, you want to pay attention to the vitamin and calorie content. Iceberg lettuce has only 14 calories per 100 grams (2 calories or less in each leaf), and 18mg of calcium.\nOther effects to consider, is when fed straight from the fridge, lettuce will be cold and wet, both are conditions that can upset a pet's stomach.\nIn addition, since most rabbit breeders do not feed lettuce to their baby rabbits, it is an unfamiliar food and if the rabbit owner does not add lettuce to the diet gradually, it will cause stomach upset.\nFinally, it is often believed amoung rabbit breeders that\n\nRabbits should not eat some lettuces (such as iceberg) as they contain a substance called laudanum which can be harmful in large quantities.\n\nRSPCA: Rabbit Diet Myths\nBut this is disputed because\n\nLettuce does not contain laudanum. Edible lettuce does contain a chemical called lactucin which is a component of lactucarian. Lactucarian is the milky fluid found in some species of lettuce and occurs in much larger amounts in wild lettuce, Lactuca virosa.\nLactucarium has sedative and analgesic effects. It creates a sense of mild euphoria. The milky exudate resembles that of opium and it can also be reduced to a thick substance which can be smoked in the same way as opium. As a result of which it acquired the name ‘lettuce opium’.\nEdible lettuce, Lactuca sativa, does not even contain lactucarium although it does contain lactucin which is in lactucarium.\n\nLettuce for Rabbits and Guinea Pigs (note that rabbits and guinea pigs have different digestive systems, this link is included for the information on lettuce composition).\nIt is not known if lactucin turns into lactucarium during the digestive process in the rabbit, there are some accounts of rabbits appearing sedated after ingesting large quantities of lettuce. Regardless of the laudanum/lactucin status, there's no reason to feed iceberg because of the low nutrient value.\nThe House Rabbit Society's website has even more details on what foods are good for rabbits and why.",

While the total tally of olfactory receptor genes exceeds 1000, more than half of them are inactive pseudogenes. The combined activity of the expressed functional receptors accounts for the number of distinct odors that can be discriminated by the human olfactory system, which is estimated to be about 10,000 (Purves, 2001).\nDifferent receptors are sensitive to subsets of chemicals that define a “tuning curve.” Depending on the particular olfactory receptor molecules they contain, some olfactory receptor neurons exhibit marked selectivity to particular chemical stimuli, whereas others are activated by a number of different odorant molecules. In addition, olfactory receptor neurons can exhibit different thresholds for a particular odorant. How these olfactory responses encode a specific odorant is a complex issue that is unlikely to be explained at the level of the primary neurons (Purves, 2001). \nSo in a way, the answer to your question is yes, as there are approximately 100 to 400 olfactory receptors. Just like the photoreceptors in the visual system, each sensory neuron in the olfactory epithelium in the nose expresses only a single receptor gene (Kimball). In the visual system for color vision there are just three (red, green and blue cones - RGB) types of sensory neurons, so it's a bit more complicated in olfaction.\nReferences\n- Purves et al, Neuroscience, 2nd ed.

    "output": "Assuming the person is not taking anticoagulants, it's actually quite difficult to bleed to death from dismemberment of small members (hands, feet, penis, ears, nose, etc). Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure. The trouble is, a normal blood pressure prevents the body from realizing it has inadequate blood volume and turns off its defensive measures, thus allowing the bleeding to continue unabated. \nLeft to fend for himself, a healthy adult would almost certainly survive having his penis removed. With modern medical care, that becomes a certainty.\nCould he still urinate? Sure, as long as the urethra wasn't blocked. It could become blocked by clotted blood, but eventually the pressure of a full bladder would overcome the blockage.\nDownvoter, care to comment?",

    "input": "",
    "output": "The answer is mostly, it is a valid guideline, but perhaps not a valid rule. It also doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nThe point being made is that for mutable types, you cannot base the hash code on the mutable data because two equal objects must return the same hash code and the hash code has to be valid for the lifetime of the object. If the hash code changes, you end up with an object that gets lost in a hashed collection because it no longer lives in the correct hash bin.\nFor example, object A returns hash of 1. So, it goes in bin 1 of the hash table. Then you change object A such that it returns a hash of 2. When a hash table goes looking for it, it looks in bin 2 and can't find it - the object is orphaned in bin 1.  This is why the hash code must not change for the lifetime of the object, and just one reason why writing GetHashCode implementations is a pain in the butt.\n\nA guideline is just a guide, not a rule. In reality, ```GetHashCode``` only has to follow these guidelines when things expect the object to follow the guidelines, such as when it is being stored in a hash table. If you never intend to use your objects in hash tables (or anything else that relies on the rules of ```GetHashCode```), your implementation doesn't need to follow the guidelines. When you see \"for the lifetime of the object\", you should read \"for the time the object needs to co-operate with hash tables\" or similar. Like most things, ```GetHashCode``` is about knowing when to break the rules.",

First, the illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.  If not, then the current position stands, and play continues.  Assuming that the move is recent, the position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.\nThen, the player that made the illegal move now must make a legal move with the same piece (if one exists).  If there are no legal moves, then the player is free to make any move.  This is due to the touch move rule.  Finally, if the offending player has pressed the clock, a two minute &quot;bonus&quot; is added to the opponent's clock to compensate them for any time lost and to penalize the offending player.\nHere is the relevant passage from the USCF rulebook:\n\n11A. Illegal move during last ten moves. If, during a game, it is found that one of either player's last ten moves was illegal, the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move counters on clocks that have them may by readjusted.\n11D. Illegal move. If, a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the opponent's clock).\n\nIn blitz chess, the rules are different.  According to the WBCA (World Blitz Chess Association) rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.  This rule is frequently enforced in casual games too.  The most common way that this occurs is that one player doesn't notice that they are in check and makes a move that doesn't get out of check.  Then the checking player simply captures the king and claims a victory.\nBecause blitz is a much faster pace game, the illegal move must be noticed within two moves.  If it is not, then the current position stands and play continues.\nAt no point is the game cancelled due to an illegal move.  Pretty much once a game starts and both players make a move, a result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded.",

If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That’s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time.\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations.",

This means that a variable used inside an anonymous inner class that is not considered ```final``` can change value unexpectedly before it is accessed.\nObject Declaration\nAn object declaration is similar to a variable declaration and therefore cannot be used on the right side of an assignment statement.  Object declarations are very useful for implementing the Singleton pattern.\n```object MySingletonObject {\n    fun getInstance(): MySingletonObject {\n        // return single instance of object\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd the ```getInstance``` method can then be invoked like this.\n```MySingletonObject.getInstance()\n```\nCompanion Object\nA companion object is a specific type of object declaration that allows an object to act similar to static objects in other languages (such as Java).  Adding ```companion``` to the object declaration allows for adding the &quot;static&quot; functionality to an object even though the actual static concept does not exist in Kotlin.

If you set $a$ to true, $b$ must be true as well. If you set $b$ to false, $a$ must be false as well. Such implications are straightforward: there is no choice, you have only $1$ possibility, there is no room for case-multiplication. You can just follow every possible implication chain, and see if you ever derive both $\\lnot l$ from $l$ and $l$ from $\\lnot l$: if you do for some $l$, then the 2-SAT formula is unsatisfiable, otherwise it is satisfiable.

It is precisely such presence of more than one possibility ($2$ possibilities in case of $3$-SAT, $k-1$ possibilities in case of $k$-SAT) that causes the typical combinatorial explosion of NP-complete problems.

He doesn't seem to have told many people about it, it's possible he didn't tell anyone at all.\n\n“Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned ‘For Enemies’, that he had marked a few weeks previously.” - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nHis book was hidden away until Harry found it, and Harry didn't tell the rest of the wizarding world about it either. Severus himself was seen using Sectumsempra when the Order was moving seven Harrys, and Harry had used it a few times after he found it in Snape's old book. Lupin knows of it, since he described it as one of Snape's specialties.\nHowever, they are probably some of the only people who know it - it isn't widely known like the three Unforgivable Curses. No one else, either in the Death Eaters or the Order of the Phoenix, is ever said to use it.  It's likely that the Ministry didn't even know of it. Therefore, the Ministry wouldn't have even been able to make the decision to classify it as an Unforgivable Curse, since they would likely not have even known it existed.\nIf the Ministry knew about it, would it be classified as Unforgivable?\nThe reason it wasn't classified as an Unforgivable Curse is because the Ministry wouldn't have known about it - they would be unable to make any decision on something they don't know exists. That, by itself, doesn't say whether the Ministry would classify it as one if they knew about it.\nNot all potentially harmful spells are classified as Unforgivable Curses.\nIt's nowhere near guaranteed, though, that if the Ministry knew about Sectumsempra, that they'd classify it as an Unforgivable Curse. There are other spells that could clearly do harm. Just to give a few examples - Confringo, Flagrante, and the creation of Fiendfyre are all potentially harmful but not Unforgivable.\nIt's never mentioned why those three curses are classified as Unforgivable and others aren't, but it seems likely that it's because there are little to no uses for them that aren't evil. The punishment for using an Unforgivable Curse is a lifetime sentence in Azkaban, so only the worst curses, that are highly unlikely to ever have a non-Dark use, would be made Unforgivable.\n\n“Now … those three curses – Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus – are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban.” - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 14 (The Unforgivable Curses)\n\nNow, would Sectumsempra fit the criteria for being made an Unforgivable Curse?\nProbably not - it cuts through things like a sword. It can be used for anything a sword, knife or other cutting tool can be used for. While using it on people might be considered Unforgivable, the spell itself is simply the act of cutting. There are many things a wizard might reasonably want to cut with no malicious intent; vegetables, rope, cloth, building materials. Because of this, it seems unlikely that even if the Ministry had known about it, it would be classified as an Unforgivable Curse.\nIn addition, there is a countercurse for Sectumsempra.\n\n“Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harry’s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy’s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting. - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nWhile the wounds from Sectumsempra can't be healed by simple healing spells, they can in fact be healed by the countercurse.\nSo - Sectumsempra likely wouldn't be made Unforgivable if the Ministry knew it.",

The Elves believe that their child-bearing process draws a heavier physical and spiritual toll on them, compared to what it does to humans. They're understandable reluctant to have a lot of kids, because what's the point in having a dozen kids if doing so might literally kill you?\n\nFrom &quot;Laws and Customs&quot;:\n\nIt might be thought that, since the Eldar do not (as Men deem) grow old in body, they may bring forth children at any time in the ages of their lives. But this is not so. For the Eldar do indeed grow older, even if slowly: the limit of their lives is the life of Arda, which though long beyond the reckoning of Men is not endless, and ages also. Moreover their body and spirit are not separated but coherent. As the weight of the years, with all their changes of desire and thought, gathers upon the spirit of the Eldar, so do the impulses and moods of their bodies change. [...]\nAlso the Eldar say that in the begetting [conceiving], and still more in the bearing of children, greater share and strength of their being, in mind and in body, goes forth than in the making of mortal children. For these reasons it came to pass that the Eldar brought forth few children; and also that their time of generation was in their youth or earlier life, unless strange and hard fates befell them.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n\nThat last point about the toll on their mind and body is worth expanding on, and fortunately Tolkien does this later in the essay:\n\n[A]ll the Eldar, being aware of it in themselves, spoke of the passing of much strength, both of mind and of body, into their children, in bearing and begetting. Therefore they hold that the fëa [soul], though unbegotten, draws nourishment directly from the fëa of the mother while she bears and nourishes the hrondo [body; later changed to the word hroä], and mediately but equally from the father, whose fëa is bound in union with the mother's and supports it.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n",

They often will grant the waiver if it's the first time, the absence is not too much over a year, and/or there is a good reason for not returning earlier (e.g. COVID-19). So if she manages to make it to a US port of entry, there is a good chance they will just let her in, perhaps with a warning.\n\nThe officer could deny her entry, and pressure her to voluntarily sign I-407 to relinquish her permanent residency. This is voluntary, and she can refuse. If she refuses, they will give her a Notice to Appear for removal proceedings in immigration court at a later date. There, she will be able to present her case to the immigration judge, and if the immigration judge determines that she has not abandoned residence, the immigration judge can grant the waiver for her failure to meet the documentary requirements (think of it as a second opinion on the immigration officer's decision).\n\nThe other option to all this is that she can apply for an SB1 returning resident visa at a US consulate (which will meet the documentary requirements since it is an immigrant visa).

    "input": "",
    "output": "Before 1947, a good case could be made that the Septuagint represented a more ancient tradition than the Masoretic versions of the Tanakh.  Since the Septuagint was produced before 132 BCE (and probably in the 3rd century BCE) and the earliest known Masoretic manuscripts date to the 10th century CE, the Greek translation might have fossilized an early rendering of the Scriptures while the Hebrew continued to be copied and potentially altered.  To further support the primacy of the Septuagint, the early Christian and Hellenistic Jewish texts, tended to use that translation rather go back to Hebrew sources.\nAn interesting counter-argument arises from the observation that during the 600 years from Jerome's translation into Latin (the Vulgate) to the earliest Masoretic manuscripts, the Hebrew seems to have been faithfully copied.  That suggests that Jewish scribes were exceptionally careful to duplicate their scriptures.\nAfter 1947, the evidence changed.  According to Wikipedia:\n\n  [Most] of the Qumran fragments can be classified as being closer to the Masoretic text than to any other text group that has survived. According to Lawrence Schiffman, 60% can be classed as being of proto-Masoretic type, and a further 20% Qumran style with bases in proto-Masoretic texts, compared to 5% proto-Samaritan type, 5% Septuagintal type, and 10% non-aligned. Joseph Fitzmyer noted the following regarding the findings at Qumran Cave 4 in particular: \"Such ancient recensional forms of Old Testament books bear witness to an unsuspected textual diversity that once existed; these texts merit far greater study and attention than they have been accorded till now. Thus, the differences in the Septuagint are no longer considered the result of a poor or tendentious attempt to translate the Hebrew into the Greek; rather they testify to a different pre-Christian form of the Hebrew text\".\n\nAnother another article describes the meaning of the categories in detail.\nA few caveats are in order:\n\n* Surveying the Qumran about religious texts seems something akin to surveying a hippie commune about political issues&mdash;you're likely to experience some bias.  If we could obtain a similar collection from Jerusalem, we'd likely find more agreement and likely the side of MT.  Given the diversity in non-Scriptural texts, 60% seems quite solid support.\n* While it's unlikely, there exists a chronological possibility the scrolls associated with the Septuagint-aligned Hebrew were influenced by the Greek.  (Any references one way or the other would be appreciated.) \n\nWhat remains therefore is a window into the community of Alexandrian Jews that produced the translation.  For those who are interested in the development of Jewish belief, that can be extremely useful.  N. T. Wright's book, The Resurrection of the Son of God, shows that the LXX translators chose to interpret key texts from Daniel and Ezekiel about the resurrection as literal rather than metaphorical.  He argues from this that belief in bodily resurrection was more common in Jesus' day than other scholars assert.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Photo films and papers are made from salts of silver that naturally only darken when exposed to violet or blue light. In the early days of photography, this was all that was available. Therefore these films and papers are able to be handled under any light source that does not radiate blue light. By the way, the violet and blue frequencies of light are the shortest, and are the most energetic when it comes to inducing a chemical change. These early films and papers could all be be handled safely under red light as well as yellow light. These lamps do not emit violet or blue. \n\nThese blue-sensitive-only films did an OK job, with some exceptions. Women’s faces with cosmetics, like lipstick and rouge on the cheeks, came out weird. Warm tones reproduced super dark, and most times lips and cheeks turned black, void of detail on the finished picture. The bottom line is, many colors in nature reproduced incorrectly with this early blue-sensitive-only film. \n\nThe cure was accidental. Professor Hermann Vogel at Berlin Technical was trying to solve the problem of halation. This results when taking a picture of bright objects, like light sources or gemstones and the like. These objects play on the film with lots of light energy. This energy often goes completely through the film and hits something behind the film. The light is then reflected back into the film. The result is a halo around bright objects. The professor had one of his students dye the silver salts yellow, thinking the yellow dye would filter out the annoying reflected blue from the rear. He tried this dyed film and it did the trick, plus the film gained sensitivity to green light. He named this blue/green sensitive film orthochromatic (Latin for correct color). The year was 1857, and the quality of film reproducing the colors of nature moved forward by a big leap. \n\nA few years later, one of his graduate students, experimenting with different dyes, discovered how to make films sensitive to blue, green and red light. This film was called panchromatic (the pan prefix in Greek means \"all\"). Thus panchromatic film reproduces all colors found in nature with high accuracy. The bad news was, the darkroom folks were forced to give up the red and yellow safelight. A super dim green safelight could be used for a short period of time during developing. \n\nPhoto papers remained insensitive to red for the most part - no need, as they work OK with just blue and green sensitivity. Modern variable contrast photo papers have two sensitive coats, one for blue light and one for green light. We can use a safelight on these papers; it is amber with reduced brilliance. \n\nFilms and papers that make color pictures are panchromatic, and most safelights are not safe. We can use infrared lamps with a specialized night vision infrared scope to view and handle most panchromatic films and papers, because these materials have low sensitivity to infrared.",

Text encoded in one code page cannot be read correctly by a program that assumes or guessed at another code page.\n\nUnicode came about to solve this disaster. Version 1 started out with 65536 code points, commonly encoded in 16 bits. Later extended in version 2 to 1.1 million code points. The current version is 6.3, using 110,187 of the available 1.1 million code points. That doesn't fit in 16 bits anymore.\nEncoding in 16-bits was common when v2 came around, used by Microsoft and Apple operating systems for example. And language runtimes like Java. The v2 spec came up with a way to map those 1.1 million code points into 16-bits. An encoding called UTF-16, a variable length encoding where one code point can take either 2 or 4 bytes.  The original v1 code points take 2 bytes, added ones take 4.  \n\nAnother variable length encoding that's very common, used in *nix operating systems and tools is UTF-8, a code point can take between 1 and 4 bytes, the original ASCII codes take 1 byte the rest take more.  The only non-variable length encoding is UTF-32, takes 4 bytes for a code point. Not often used since it is pretty wasteful. There are other ones, like UTF-1 and UTF-7, widely ignored.\nAn issue with the UTF-16/32 encodings is that the order of the bytes will depend on the endian-ness of the machine that created the text stream. So add to the mix UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE.\n\nHaving these different encoding choices brings back the code page disaster to some degree, along with heated debates among programmers which UTF choice is \"best\". Their association with operating system defaults pretty much draws the lines. One counter-measure is the definition of a BOM, the Byte Order Mark, a special codepoint (U+FEFF, zero width space) at the beginning of a text stream that indicates how the rest of the stream is encoded. It indicates both the UTF encoding and the endianess and is neutral to a text rendering engine.

    "input": "",
    "output": "These are a few extra points to complement Andrew Rosen's comprehensive response:\n\n* To be absolutely clear, typical DFT calculations are not performed at 0K, a better description of what happens is that they are performed \"for a static crystal\". Static crystal means that the atoms are fixed at their crystallographic positions (which is what a typical DFT calculation does), but this situation is different from 0K. Even at 0K, the atomic nuclei move due to quantum zero-point motion (also called quantum fluctuations). This quantum zero-point motion is very small for compounds containing heavy elements, which means that in these cases \"0K\" and \"static crystal\" are almost the same and many people use the terms interchangeably. However, quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen (the lightest of all compounds) it dominates even at room temperature. To perform a calculation at 0K (as opposed to a static crystal calculation), the strategy that Andrew Rosen proposed would still work if you use quantum statistics. For example, solving the vibrational problem within the harmonic approximation at the quantum mechanical level with give you the zero-point energy as the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. A good reference for hydrogen is this review article.\n* Although Andrew Rosen is correct in that the potential energy surface is largely temperature independent, there are a few situations in which the potential energy surface does vary significantly with temperature. An example of this is provided by many perovskite crystals (e.g. $\\ce{BaTiO_3}$), which undergo a series of temperature-induced structural phase transitions. For example, at very high temperatures the structure is cubic, and this structure sits at a minimum of the potential free energy surface. However, if you calculated the potential energy surface (instead of the free energy surface), then it has a double-well shape and the cubic structure is at the saddle point, so the structure will lower its energy by distorting and going to one of the minima. This is precisely what happens at low temperatures because the corresponding free energy surface acquires a double-well shape, and the system undergoes a structural phase transition. A good early DFT reference for this is this paper.\n* As already pointed out by others, the differences between DFT and TDDFT or $GW$-BSE are not related to the inclusion or exclusion of temperature. In this language, both TDDFT and $GW$-BSE have no temperature for the behaviour of the nuclei, and you could incoporate it in a similar fashion to what Andrew Rosen described for DFT.\n",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Here's a brief overview to get you started. Hopefully this helps!\n\n* 'Gain' controls are typically used to get a good input level. So for example if you had a microphone with a very low output signal, you would boost the gain to get a better level into your mixing desk or audio interface. If you had a synthesizer plugged in you might need to turn the gain down to stop the signal distorting. Gain controls are often controlling an amplifier behind the scenes - i.e. your signal can 'gain' strength after going through the gain stage of your audio equipment. So gain is usually the first control in the signal path of your recording equipment. \n\n* 'Volume' controls on the other hand tend to be at the end of the signal chain and are more likely to be attenuating rather than amplifying the signal. So on a mixing desk, having got a good level from each input at the gain stage, you use the volume faders to adjust the relative volumes of each channel to achieve a good mix. You are not typically amplifying those signals any more though.\n\nA guitar amp is a good example of how this works. The first control is often called \"Gain\" or 'drive' and guitarists often deliberately turn this really high to get a nice distorted sound from a tube preamp. However, the final control is called Volume and governs simply how loud the sound coming out of your speaker is. With gain right up and volume low you can play distorted sounds without annoying the neighbours. With gain low and volume high you get a loud sound but no distortion.",

But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands.\n\nFinally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand.

Early graphics cards had virtually no callable code associated with them at all, the concept of \"drivers\" had not quite become a reality yet. There was the concept of a Video BIOS, which were extensions to the ```INT 10h``` BIOS video services, that were effectively limited to initialization and switching video modes. \nInstead, graphics cards, at least in DOS land, all had memory mapped display RAM, and extensive documentation was available about exactly how setting various bits in display RAM would affect the pixels that appeared on the screen. There were no drawing APIs to call, if you wanted something to appear on the screen (whether it be a pixel, a character, a line, a circle, a sprite, etc) you would write the code to move the bytes into the right places in display RAM. Entire books were written about how to write efficient code to draw graphics.\nThere were some systems like the Borland Graphics Interface that abstracted graphics drawing primitives into an API with different drivers that one could call to draw things on different graphics cards. However, these were typically slower than what would be required for building action type games.\nAn action game would typically be optimized for a particular graphics display mode on a particular card. For example, a popular display mode was VGA 640x480 with 16 colors. This would be listed in the software requirements, and you needed to have the right hardware to support the game. If you bought a VGA game but you only had an EGA card, then the game would not work at all.

    "input": "",
    "output": "There are two overarching types of variables in Java:\n\n1. Primitives: variables that contain data. If you want to manipulate the data in a primitive variable you can manipulate that variable directly. By convention primitive types start with a lowercase letter. For example variables of type `int` or `char` are primitives.\n\n2. References: variables that contain the memory address of an `Object` i.e. variables that refer to an `Object`. If you want to manipulate the `Object` that a reference variable refers to you must dereference it. Dereferencing usually entails using `.` to access a method or field, or using `[` to index an array. By convention reference types are usually denoted with a type that starts in uppercase. For example variables of type `Object` are references.\n\nConsider the following code where you declare a variable of primitive type `int` and don't initialize it:\n```\nint x;\nint y = x + x;\n```\nThese two lines will crash the program because no value is specified for `x` and we are trying to use `x`'s value to specify `y`. All primitives have to be initialized to a usable value before they are manipulated.\n\nNow here is where things get interesting. Reference variables can be set to `null` which means \"I am referencing nothing\". You can get a `null` value in a reference variable if you explicitly set it that way, or a reference variable is uninitialized and the compiler does not catch it (Java will automatically set the variable to `null`).\n\nIf a reference variable is set to null either explicitly by you or through Java automatically, and you attempt to dereference it you get a `NullPointerException`.\n\nThe `NullPointerException` (NPE) typically occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object and assign it to the variable before trying to use the contents of the variable. So you have a reference to something that does not actually exist.\n\nTake the following code:\n```\nInteger num;\nnum = new Integer(10);\n```\nThe first line declares a variable named `num`, but it does not actually contain a reference value yet. Since you have not yet said what to point to, Java sets it to `null`.\n\nIn the second line, the `new` keyword is used to instantiate (or create) an object of type `Integer`, and the `reference` variable `num` is assigned to that `Integer` object.\n\nIf you attempt to dereference `num` before creating the object you get a `NullPointerException`. In the most trivial cases, the compiler will catch the problem and let you know that \"`num may not have been initialized`,\" but sometimes you may write code that does not directly create the object.\n\nFor instance, you may have a method as follows:\n```\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {\n   // Do something to obj, assumes obj is not null\n   obj.myMethod();\n}\n```\nIn which case, you are not creating the object `obj`, but rather assuming that it was created before the `doSomething()` method was called. Note, it is possible to call the method like this:\n```\ndoSomething(null);\n```\nIn which case, `obj` is `null`, and the statement `obj.myMethod()` will throw a `NullPointerException`.\n\nIf the method is intended to do something to the passed-in object as the above method does, it is appropriate to throw the `NullPointerException` because it's a programmer error and the programmer will need that information for debugging purposes.\n\nIn addition to `NullPointerException`'s thrown as a result of the method's logic, you can also check the method arguments for `null` values and throw NPEs explicitly by adding something like the following near the beginning of a method:\n```\n// Throws an NPE with a custom error message if obj is null\nObjects.requireNonNull(obj, \"obj must not be null\");\n```\n\nNote that it's helpful to say in your error message clearly which object cannot be `null`. The advantage of validating this is that 1) you can return your own clearer error messages and 2) for the rest of the method you know that unless `obj` is reassigned, it is not null and can be dereferenced safely.\n\nAlternatively, there may be cases where the purpose of the method is not solely to operate on the passed in object, and therefore a null parameter may be acceptable. In this case, you would need to check for a null parameter and behave differently. You should also explain this in the documentation. For example, `doSomething()` could be written as:\n```\n/**\n  * @param obj An optional foo for ____. May be null, in which case\n  *  the result will be ____.\n  */\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {\n    if(obj == null) {\n       // Do something\n    } else {\n       // Do something else\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, how to pinpoint the exception & cause using Stack Trace:\n\n> What methods/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop the exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?\n\nSonar with find bugs can detect NPE. Can sonar catch null pointer exceptions caused by JVM Dynamically\n\nNow Java 14 has added a new language feature to show the root cause of NullPointerException. This language feature has been part of SAP commercial JVM since 2006. In Java 14, the following is a sample NullPointerException Exception message:\n\n> in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"java.util.List.size()\" because \"list\" is null",

In a non-looped network,  one MAC address will only be visible to the switch on a given physical port.  If you have a loop, then the switch will see multiple paths to the same MAC address, and possibly multiple MAC addresses on multiple ports, so instead of the traffic being switched efficiently, it will be broadcast to wherever it sees the MACs.

This is kind of slow, but it works:\n```$ find . -type f -exec ls -l {} \\; | awk '{sum += $5} END {print sum}'\n60527\n```\nThis value matches exactly the number reported by Finder's Get Info window. (There are no weird forks or xattrs in this set of files.) It's significantly smaller than the value reported by ```du```.\nHere's how it works: it gets a list of all the files, and passes them to ```ls -l```; then ```awk``` is used to count up the bytes. The ```-type f``` flag is there so that only files (and not directories) get sent to ```ls```. Without that flag, it'll also send directory names to ```ls```, and each file will be listed twice : once as an individual file, and once as an item in the directory.\nThe GNU version of ```du``` can give values in actual bytes instead of blocks. It's unfortunate that the BSD version of ```du``` is not as flexible.",

    "output": "## static_cast\n\n`static_cast` is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. `static_cast` performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Here is an example:\n\n```\nvoid func(void *data) {\n  // Conversion from MyClass* -> void* is implicit\n  MyClass *c = static_cast<MyClass*>(data);\n  ...\n}\n\nint main() {\n  MyClass c;\n  start_thread(&func, &c)  // func(&c) will be called\n      .join();\n}\n```\nIn this example, you know that you passed a `MyClass` object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this.\n\n## dynamic_cast\n\n`dynamic_cast` is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a `bad_cast` exception is thrown in that case).\n\n```\nif (JumpStm *j = dynamic_cast<JumpStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n} else if (ExprStm *e = dynamic_cast<ExprStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n}\n```\nAn \"up-cast\" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast`, and also without any cast, as an \"up-cast\" is an implicit conversion (assuming the base class is accessible, i.e. it's a `public` inheritance).\n\n## Regular Cast\n\nThese casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering `dynamic_cast`. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of `const_cast`, `static_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use `dynamic_cast`.\n\nIn addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the \"equivalent\" `static_cast` sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.\n\nSome people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking.",

    "output": "The main answer is logistical. Building a network of pipes to convey water to houses is a major effort, and most places where that's been done found it extremely expensive. Providing a second set of pipes to bring salt water to houses would probably cost about the same. Except that cities go to considerable lengths to put their water reservoirs above the city as far as possible so they don't have to use as much energy for pumping. The few cities with seawater above them pay a lot to pump water out.\nA minor secondary problem is that sewage treatment plants are fairly heavily biological. They grow things in the sewage to break it down. But most of those things won't grow in salt water. It's already a challenge keeping toxic chemicals out of the sewage. For this to work it might be necessary to add a second set of sewer pipes to carry the water away, and develop new methods of treating that salty sewage (the treated sewage couldn't be spread on farmland, for example).\nIt would be far simpler, cheaper and more reliable to simply buy everyone a composting toilet to replace each toilet they currently have. As a halfway measure, mandating more economical toilets would help, as would education campaigns like the  ones encouraging people not to flush at all when they urinate. Even with a sensible cistern that has a 2 litre &quot;half flush&quot;, that's two litres wasted every time someone pees.\nAdditionally, salt is not good for pipes. A lot of pipes, even today, are clay or concrete, and salt water is bad for both of these. It's not impossible to get around that, just expensive.",

    "output": "Welcome to Rusty Dagger Shanktown!\nWhat you have noticed is very widely commented upon—1st level is often called “rusty dagger shanktown.” It’s hyper-lethal, rather than the kind of heroic fantasy Dungeons & Dragons pitches itself as. It is very, very difficult for 1st-level PCs to actually really adventure at all. Many, many groups avoid 1st for this reason (many skip 2nd too, even though it is already dramatically different). Personally, I’ll include 1st level often, but the PCs basically always level-up to 2nd almost entirely on roleplaying XP.\nNote that this isn’t unique to 3.5e; it goes back to the earliest days of D&D. Pathfinder, of course, inherited it from 3.5e (I don’t know about PF 2e). It’s also very much still true in 5e—after 4e actually managed to avoid it, which may mean that this is considered a “feature” by some, enough that Wizards of the Coast felt the need to restore it as part of 5e’s general “return to form” after the divisive fourth edition.\nAnyway, the primary causes of rusty dagger shanktown:\nHit points\nAlmost anyone can one-shot almost any 1st-level character. It’s very, very easy to have 6 hp in a world where a decent, but basic, weapon’s base damage averages 7. Even smaller weapons can easily deal that much damage, either through luck or skill. We expect 1st-level characters to often go down in one hit.\nA 2nd-level character can have nearly twice as much hp. Actually, could easily be twice as much, if they multiclass from a small-HD class to a large-HD class. That drastically changes the game, because suddenly you can feel reasonably confident that you aren’t going to just suddenly die before anyone can do anything. Healing actually becomes relevant, where at 1st it’s often too little, too late.\nNotably, this only has this effect because damage doesn’t grow at the same rate. The base damage of weapons is fixed, and ability scores start at double digits but grow very slowly from there. That’s the biggest chunk of early damage for most characters. Even beyond that, a lot of damage boosts—inspire courage, rage, sneak attack—come at 1st anyway. And monsters tend to kind of mirror these trends.\nSo what ends up happening is that a 1st-level character can’t really take a chance in order to get something accomplished. A 2nd-level character can feel reasonably comfortable taking a chance at least once. That dramatically affects the style of play. At 2nd-level D&D literally feels like a different game. Really, it is a different game.\nWealth\nCharacters start with less than 200 gp worth of gear. That’s not enough for a masterwork weapon, not enough even for non-masterwork medium or heavy armors, definitely not enough for any kind of magic item beyond maybe an extremely basic consumable. No 1st-level character has even their complete basic kit yet.\nThe expected wealth of a 2nd-level character is 900 gp. That can afford masterwork armor of anything short of full-plate, and for many armors leave enough left over for a masterwork weapon. Most importantly, that is enough money for a party of 4 to trivially afford a wand of cure light wounds. A wand of cure light wounds is a game-changer. It means you can easily start every fight at full hp. And with 2nd-level hp, that means you can actually take a few risks.\n2nd-level features\nThis varies considerably from one class to the next, but several classes get major class features at 2nd level. The paladin’s 2nd-level feature, divine grace, might be the single greatest class feature in the game (assuming we don’t count “spells” and the like as a singular feature). Rangers don’t get their combat style until 2nd. Bards get 1st-level spells at 2nd (though inspire courage from 1st level is probably more important). Outside of core, meldshapers don’t get any chakra binds until 2nd, which can leave them with zero offense at 1st. Swordsages don’t get Wis-to-AC until 2nd.\nBut plenty of characters are fine from 1st, so this can vary a lot.",

Your plant needs to adjust to these conditions.  You should try to begin to place your plants in a very lit area with as much natural wind / fan as possible, these plants need to breath.  If your plants are not conditioned for this type of environment you run the risk that they give up and die.\n\nWhen potting the plant ensure the actual pot is cleaned up to remove any unnecessary plant diseases from prior plants.  Look on the bottom of the actual pot, are you getting drainage?  If not drill a hole in the bottom of the pot if you can, if not toss that pot out and get you a pot that has a good amount of drainage.  Overwatering plants will destroy them, and without nature (wind, temperature, etc) the water sitting there takes all the longer to dry out.\n\nWhen it comes to veggies Tomatoes need a ton of sunlight and humidity is great for them as well.

    "output": "The main advantage is that by learning higher frequency words, you get a greater \"bang for your buck\" - that is, if you know the most frequent words of the language, you'll be able to understand more of the words you encounter, and therefore you gain the greatest benefit by studying those frequent words first.\nAccording to Nation & Waring (1997),  text coverage in the Brown corpus is as follows:\n\n* Most frequent 1000 words:    72.0%\n* Most frequent 2000 words:    79.7%\n* Most frequent 3000 words:    84.0%\n* Most frequent 4000 words:    86.8%.\n\nSo by learning the top 1000 words, you'll know 72% of the words in the average text you read.  But after that, there are diminishing returns: the next 1000 words gives you another 7.7% of a typical text, and the next 1000 words allows you to understand just 4.3% more.  After that, the returns on memorizing by frequency decrease even more, so learning from frequency lists becomes less useful.\nNote that text coverage (the percentage of words that you know in an average text) is important.  We don't need to understand every single word in a text in order to understand the general meaning.  Some research has investigated what percentage of words we do need to understand. Laufer and Sim (1985) suggested 65-70% should be understood as an absolute minimum for comprehension, but Laufer (1989) (as described in Hu and Nation (2000)) suggests 95% should be known for solid comprehension.  Hu and Nation (2000) suggest that 98% of words should be known for unaided comprehension.  \nAlthough learning high-frequency words is a good idea, especially when you first start learning a language, frequency is not the only consideration when choosing words to learn.  Barker (2007) suggests that \"cost\" and \"benefit\" be the primary considerations when choosing words to learn; benefit is partially defined by frequency, but also on personal needs.  \nSo it's good to learn the \"technical\" vocabulary of your major or field, and it's also useful to learn words related to your interest.  It's also beneficial to learn words with a lower \"cost\" - words that are familiar, that you've encountered a lot recently, or that just seem easy.\nAlso, although memorizing words has benefits, it is best to combine this with real exposure to words, so that you learn them naturally in real contexts.",

",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Considering just electrical properties, the most significant parameter for your selection of antenna conductor is resistance. You want to keep the resistance to a minimum, because when current flows through a resistance, the electrical power is converted to heat, according to Joule heating:\n$$ P = I^2 R $$\nAny energy you use to make heat is energy you aren't using to make electromagnetic waves.\nSo first, you should consider the resistivity ($\\rho$) of various metals. A lower resistivity means you will need less of a metal to reduce the resistance to an acceptable target. Here's a selection, ordered from lowest to highest resistivity in nano-ohm-meters (nΩm), of some metals you might consider using in an antenna:\n\n* Silver: 15.9\n* Copper: 16.8\n* Gold: 24.4\n* Aluminium: 26.2\n* Zinc: 59.0\n* Nickel: 69.9\n* Iron: 100\n* Tin: 109\n\nI'm not going to list stainless steel because there are so many kinds, but generally stainless steels are not great conductors, being over 100 on this scale.\nA high resistivity isn't bad in itself, because you can compensate by making the conductor thicker, and end up with the same resistance. Thus, you might think copper is the best choice (ruling out silver due to high cost), but when you start making mechanical and cost considerations, you may find aluminium is better. This is because for a sample of copper and another of aluminium of equal resistance, the aluminium sample will be bigger, but stiffer, lighter, and cheaper. \nThere's another effect to consider here: with increasing frequency, currents like to flow on the surfaces of conductors. This is called the skin effect. The current flowing only on the skin of a conductor effectively reduces the cross-sectional area, and thus the conductance.\nSince most of the RF current is only on the surface, it often makes sense to build antennas from tubing for antennas requiring rigid elements (a 440 MHz Yagi), or copper-clad steel for wire antennas requiring tensile strength (a 40 meter dipole). This saves weight and cost for a negligible increase in loss.\nMagnetic permeability is a factor in skin depth. With increasing permeability, the skin depth decreases, increasing loss. Of the metals listed above, only iron and nickel have significantly higher permeability. Iron by a factor of about 5000, and nickel by 100 to 600. You could compensate for the reduced skin depth by increasing the surface area of the conductor, but when you consider cost and mechanics, it usually makes more sense to simply avoid iron and nickel and alloys containing them.",

So, how exactly was multitasking of Windows binaries achieved if Windows 3.1 was simply a regular old MS-DOS program itself? Are there any old technical documents still floating around that describe the early Windows architecture internally?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "For Win16 programs, Windows implemented co-operative multitasking. Its implementation was based upon the &quot;message loop&quot; architecture of every Windows program.\n\nThe duty of every program was to endlessly run in a loop in which a call to the ```GetMessage``` function was performed. This function call looks whether a message to this process is in the queue. If there is one, it is retrieved (```GetMessage```), optionally translated (```TranslateMessage```, done to convert keyboard shortcuts into menu actions) and finally, passed to the window procedure (```DispatchMessage```).\n\nIf there is no message available in the queue, Windows suspends the current task and gives the CPU to another task. This task will try to retrieve a message from its queue as well, yielding the CPU to another task if no message is present and so on.\n\nIf a program needed to perform background tasks while there were no pending messages in its queue, it would call ```PeekMessage``` instead of ```GetMessage```. This didn't make the task relinquish the CPU, as ```PeekMessage``` would immediately return to the caller task to inform it whether a message is available or not. This was used to time-multiplex message processing with another time-consuming task (think of a 3D program rendering but letting the user cancel that render by pressing a &quot;Cancel&quot; button).\n\nIf this time-consuming task was actually very time-consuming, a well-behaved program should call the ```Yield``` function from time to time, to relinquish the CPU and let other tasks run. A badly-behaved program could easily hog the CPU by not retrieving messages too often or by spending too much time in a window procedure function.\n\nThe situation was quite different for MS-DOS boxes. They ran using the V8086 mode of the 80386 (if Windows was running in enhanced mode). Windows-aware programs ran in the so-called System VM (Virtual Machine 1). DOS boxes ran from VM 2 upwards. DOS programs usually were badly-behaved programs, so Windows assigned each DOS box a different virtual machine. Virtual machines used pre-emptive multitasking in Windows 3.1, so each DOS box could run concurrently to others and to any Windows-aware program.",

Therefore:\nIf your maximum potential culture / turn won't increase by at least 30% due to the new city, you are hurting, not helping, the time till your next social policy.\n(This may be slightly hard to calculate, and if you take too long to reach your &quot;maximum potential culture / turn&quot; you're actually wasting turns.)\nThe long answer is...\nIt depends\nTo begin with, we need to make some assumptions:\n\n* When you found a new city, you can get its culture / turn maximized within a single turn by buying the necessary building improvements (monument, etc).\n\n* Ignore city-states, leader specific abilities, +culture social policies, and wonders. These all help produce culture, and will shift the &quot;ideal city count&quot; down, but do so inconsistently. To produce an &quot;ideal&quot; city count, we limit ourselves by era and improvements alone.\n\n* This list of social policy costs is accurate for the given parameters: medium map and normal speed.\n\nAnd now, some math.\nThe 1st social policy costs 25 points with a single city. In the ancient era, your cities can generate 2 culture / turn due to the monument. (Remember, we're ignoring the palace for now)\nThis means that it will take 13 turns (Ceiling(25/2) to enact the policy, or 9 turns (ceiling (45/4) with two cities. We can continue this extrapolation -- 8 turns with 3 cities, 7 turns with 4 cities, 6 turns with 5 cities, and we finally reach diminishing returns at city 6 (also 6 turns).\nFor the second social policy, the ramifications of the # of cities gets magnified due to a larger starting value: One city takes 23 turns, two cities take 15 turns, three cities take 13 turns, four cities take 12, five cities take 10, and again, we run into diminishing returns cap out at at six cities (10 turns).\nIt is not until the 4th social policy that this trend is broken and diminishing returns end at the NINTH! city.\nRemember -- this assumes that each city has a monument the minute it is founded.\nNow let's say we've reached the classical age, and have temples in addition to monuments. Each city is now generating 5 culture.\nThe first policy takes 5 turns with a single city, 4 turns with two, and 3 with three.\nWhat (hopefully) becomes clear is that we reached diminishing returns (4 cities as opposed to 6 cities) much faster when each individual city's contribution is higher. The more culture any one city is capable of producing, the more incentive there is to produce more cities. Even if you don't manage to build every +culture improvement immediately, you're still likely to come out ahead (as long as you're pre-diminishing returns).\nSo while the optimal number of cities changes due to any number of factors, you can probably safely not shoot yourself in the foot if you stay between three and six cities, with six being on the high end.",

Including bitcode will allow Apple to re-optimize your app binary in the future without the need to submit a new version of your app to the store.\n\nThis phrase in \"New Features in Xcode 7\" made me to think for a long time that Bitcode is needed for Slicing to reduce app size: \n\n  When you archive for submission to the App Store, Xcode will compile your app into an intermediate representation. The App Store will then compile the bitcode down into the 64 or 32 bit executables as necessary.\n\nHowever that's not true, Bitcode and Slicing work independently: Slicing is about reducing app size and generating app bundle variants, and Bitcode is about certain binary optimizations. I've verified this by checking included architectures in executables of non-bitcode apps and founding that they only include necessary ones.\nBitcode allows other App Thinning component called Slicing to generate app bundle variants with particular executables for particular architectures, e.g. iPhone 5S variant will include only arm64 executable, iPad Mini armv7 and so on.\n\n> When to enable ENABLE_BITCODE in new Xcode?\n\n  For iOS apps, bitcode is the default, but optional. If you provide bitcode, all apps and frameworks in the app bundle need to include bitcode. For watchOS and tvOS apps, bitcode is required.\n\n> What happens to the binary when ENABLE_BITCODE is enabled in the new Xcode?\nFrom Xcode 7 reference: \n\n> Activating this setting indicates that the target or project should generate bitcode during compilation for platforms and architectures which support it.  For Archive builds, bitcode will be generated in the linked binary for submission to the app store.  For other builds, the compiler and linker will check whether the code complies with the requirements for bitcode generation, but will not generate actual bitcode. ",

Dupire equation implies that there exits an unique continuous function $\\sigma_{loc}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma_{loc}^{2}(K,T)=\\frac{\\partial_{T}C(K,T)+rK\\partial_{K}C(K,T)}{\\frac{1}{2}K^{2}\\partial_{KK}C(K,T)}$$ for all $(K,T)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ such that the solution to the stochastic differential equation $dS_{t}/S_{t}=rdt+\\sigma(t,S_{t})dW_{t}$ exactly generates the European call option prices.\nWhat do the dynamics of the local volatility mean? Are dynamics equivalent to the volatility surface? Why the dynamics of local volatility model is highly unrealistic?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A general model (with continuous paths) can be written\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r_t dt + \\sigma_t dW_t^S\n$$\nwhere the short rate $r_t$ and spot volatility $\\sigma_t$ are stochastic processes. \nIn the Black-Scholes model both $r$ and $\\sigma$ are deterministic functions of time (even constant in the original model). This produces a flat smile for any expiry $T$. And we have the closed form formula for option prices\n$$\n  C(t,S;T,K) = BS(S,T-t,K;\\Sigma(T,K))\n$$\nwhere $BS$ is the BS formula and $\\Sigma(T,K) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_t^T \\sigma(s)^2 ds}$. This is not consistent with the smile observed on the market. In order to match market prices, one needs to use a different volatility for each expiry and strike. This is the implied volatility surface $(T,K) \\mapsto \\Sigma(T,K)$. \nIn the local volatility model, rates are deterministic, instant volatility is stochastic but there is only one source of randomness\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r(t) dt + \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) dW_t^S\n$$\nthis is a special case of the general model with\n$$\n  d\\sigma_t = (\\partial_t \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + r(t)S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + \\frac{1}{2}S_t^2\\partial_S^2\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)) dt + \\frac{1}{2}S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)^2 dW_t^S\n$$\nWhat is appealing with this model is that the function $\\sigma_{Dup}$ can be perfectly calibrated to match all market vanilla prices (and quite easily too). \nThe problem is that while correlated to the spot, statistical study show that the volatility also has its own source of randomness independent of that of the spot. Mathematically, this means the instant correlation between the spot and vol is not 1 contrary to what happens in the local volatility model. \nThis can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. The forward smile. Forward implied volatility is implied from prices of forward start options: ignoring interest rates,\n$$\n  C(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K) := E^Q[(\\frac{S_{T+\\theta}}{S_{T}}-K)_+] =: C_{BS}(S=1,\\theta,K;\\Sigma(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K))\n$$\nAlternatively, it is sometimes defined as the expectation of implied volatility at a forward date. In a LV model, as the maturity $T$ increases but $\\theta$ is kept constant, the forward smile gets flatter and higher. This is not what we observe in the markets where the forward smile tends to be similar to the current smile.\n\nThis is because the initial smile you calibrate the model too has decreasing skew:\n$$\n\\partial_K \\Sigma(0,S;T,K) \\xrightarrow[T\\to +\\infty]{} 0\n$$ \n\n2. Smile rolling. In a LV model, smile tends to move in the opposite direction of the spot and get higher independently of the direction of the spot.\nThis is not consistent with what is observed on markets. See Hagan and al. Managing Smile Risk for the derivation. This means that\n$\\partial_S \\Sigma_{LV}(t,S;T,K)$ often has the wrong sign so your Delta will be wrong which can lead to a higher hedging error than using BS. \n3. Barrier options. In FX markets, barrier options like Double No Touch are liquid but a LV model calibrated to vanilla prices does not reproduce these prices. This is a consequence of the previous point.   \n\nThe LV model is a static model. Its whole dynamic comes from the volatility surface at time 0. But the vol surface has a dynamic that is richer than that.\nThere are alternatives using multiple factors like SV models, LSV models (parametric local vol like SABR or fully non parametric local vol), models of the joint dynamic of the spot and vol surface etc... but the LV model remains the default model in many cases due to its simplicity, its ability to calibrate the initial smile perfectly and its numerical efficiency.

    "input": "",
    "output": "Random forest uses bagging (picking a sample of observations rather than all of them) and random subspace method (picking a sample of features rather than all of them, in other words - attribute bagging) to grow a tree. If the number of observations is large, but the number of trees is too small, then some observations will be predicted only once or even not at all. If the number of predictors is large but the number of trees is too small, then some features can (theoretically) be missed in all subspaces used. Both cases results in the decrease of random forest predictive power. But the last is a rather extreme case, since the selection of subspace is performed at each node.\n\nDuring classification the subspace dimensionality is $\\sqrt{p}$ (rather small, $p$ is the total number of predictors) by default, but a tree contains many nodes. During regression the subspace dimensionality is $p/3$ (large enough) by default, though a tree contains fewer nodes. So the optimal number of trees in a random forest depends on the number of predictors only in extreme cases. \n\nThe official page of the algorithm states that random forest does not overfit, and you can use as much trees as you want. But Mark R. Segal (April 14 2004. \"Machine Learning Benchmarks and Random Forest Regression.\" Center for Bioinformatics & Molecular Biostatistics) has found that it overfits for some noisy datasets. So to obtain optimal number you can try training random forest at a grid of ```ntree``` parameter (simple, but more CPU-consuming) or build one random forest with many trees with ```keep.inbag```, calculate out-of-bag (OOB) error rates for first $n$ trees (where $n$ changes from $1$ to ```ntree```) and plot OOB error rate vs. number of trees (more complex, but less CPU-consuming).",

Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic systems.

Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with autopilot for cars all the time\n\nTo answer your question, for something to be considered as \"having AI\", it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments/circumstances in order to achieve its objective/goal, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular neural net, through to probabilistic models like bayesian networks (belief networks) - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Yes, some gases can diffuse into and through metal. It is the bane of the high-vacuum engineer's life. Hydrogen is the worst because it tends to dissociate into atoms at the surface and the nucleus, a single proton, can then leave its electron behind and wander through the metal lattice until it picks up another electron when it leaves.\n\nFor example Mu-metal, favoured for some applications, typically has to be annealed in hydrogen at high temperature. Once that is over, it can take weeks or months for the residual hydrogen to diffuse out of the metal before a high enough vacuum can be achieved and the work proceed.\n\nA &quot;virtual leak&quot; occurs where a small bubble of gas is embedded in the material inside a vacuum chamber. The leak usually happens because a tiny hole exists for the gas to diffuse out through, but sometimes the &quot;hole&quot; is no more than an ultra-thin skin of metal (invisible to the frustrated technician) and the gas diffuses through it. These little horrors can keep going for months or even years and generally mean replacing suspected parts and pumping down over and over again until the dodgy one is finally stumbled on.\n\nHelium is both monatomic and the physically smallest atom. It can diffuse more easily than any other neutral atom or molecule, making certain metal foils unsuitable as say gas-tight liners for airships. As noted in another answer, in quantity it can also affect the bulk properties of the metal.\n\nOn a more energetic scale, hydrogen and helium nuclei (protons and alpha particles) can pass through thin metal foils if fired with sufficient energy, and this has been used to establish the crystalline structures of some metals and alloys (where, for whatever reason, electrons were unsuitable).\n\nOther gases have much larger atoms (neon and other noble gases) or molecules (nitrogen and other diatomic molecules, water and other hydrides), but they can still diffuse extremely slowly through some metals. This can limit the lifetime of some microchips. A related phenomenon occurs where there is a defect in the lattice at the surface, such as a grain boundary, and a gas atom attaches to it. Defects are sometimes quite mobile and can migrate through the lattice; the gas atom will stabilise the defect and may be able to hitch a ride.\n\nQuantum processes such as tunnelling are not really relevant, as they work over distances smaller than the atomic wavelength, which in turn is typically far smaller than the thickness of any metal atom or foil. The probability of a gas atom tunnelling across is so infinitesimal as to be effectively zero.",

The dashes represent numbers that do not begin with {1,3,4,9}, and so are unusable in our path.\n ```1024  3072  9216  ----   ----   ----    ----    ----     ----     ----      ----     .```\n ```----  1536  4608  13824  41472  124416  373248  1119744  3359232  10077696  30233088 .```\n ```----  ----  ----  ----   ----   ----    186624  ----     1679616  ----      15116544 .```\n ```128   384   1152  3456   10368  31104   93312   ----     ----     ----      ----     .```\n ```----  192   ----  1728   ----   15552   46656   139968   419904   1259712   3779136  .```\n ```32    96    ----  ----   ----   ----    ----    ----     ----     ----      1889568  .```\n ```16    48    144   432    1296   3888    11664   34992    104976   314928    944784   .```\n ```----  ----  ----  ----   ----   1944    ----    17496    ----     157464    472392   .```\n ```4     12    36    108    324    972     ----    ----     ----     ----      ----     .```\n ```----  ----  18    ----   162    486     1458    4374     13122    39366     118098   .```\n ```1     3     9     ----   ----   ----    ----    ----     ----     19683     ----     .```\n From here, we can see two different routes of 28 steps each: (1536->373248->93312->384->48->3888->972->36->9->1) and (1536->373248->46656->3779136->944784->3888->972->36->9->1).  \n\nProving minimality:  \n\n   Since a path of length 28 exists (we've found two), we can rule out anything that's too far away to be used in a shortest path.\n Moving from (1,9) to (0,0) must take at least ten steps on its own, so we can move at most nine steps completely out of the way (and nine steps back) in a shortest route. That limits us to only considering x-coordinates up to 10; any further would require making at least ten '*3' steps, eleven '÷3' steps, and at least nine '÷2' steps, putting the route definitely longer than 28.\n With our x-coordinate limited to [0,10], we now look at the bottlenecks.\n It should be clear that any shortest route must start by going from 1536 to 93312 in seven steps, and must end by going from 3888 to 1 in nine steps. These are both forced by unique bottlenecks; there is only one way to step from $(x,7)$ to $(x,6)$ and only one way to step from $(x,3)$ to $(x,2)$ in this range.\n This leaves at most twelve steps to go from 93312 to 3888. Either by observation or by pointing out that there are only two ways to go from $(x,6)$ to $(x,5)$, we can see that there are exactly two shortest routes from 93312 to 3888, and both require all twelve steps.\n Therefore, the shortest route is 28 steps, and there are exactly two ways to do so, both of which are described in Jo's solution and below the chart.    \n",

    "input": "",
    "output": "There are several benefits of using ```%s``` over ```+``` for string concatenation in Python:\n* Readability. The format string syntax is more readable, as it separates style from the data. Also, in Python, ```%s``` syntax will automatically coerce any non ```str``` types to ```str```; while concatenation only works with ```str```, and you can't concatenate ```str``` with ```int```.\n* Performance. In Python ```str``` is immutable, so the left and right string have to be copied into the new string for every pair of concatenation. If you concatenate four strings of length 10, you will be copying (10+10) + ((10+10)+10) + (((10+10)+10)+10) = 90 characters, instead of just 40 characters. And things gets quadratically worse as the number and size of the string increases. Java optimizes this case some of the times by transforming the series of concatenation to use ```StringBuilder```, but CPython doesn't.\n* For some use cases, the logging library provide an API that uses format string to create the log entry string lazily (```logging.info(\"blah: %s\", 4)```). This is great for improved performance if the logging library decided that the current log entry will be discarded by a log filter, so it doesn't need to format the string.\n",

    "output": "First stages are generally run to depletion (though not complete depletion). First stage ascents often use a preprogrammed, open loop guidance system to get out of the atmosphere with a good chunk of downrange velocity. Because winds aloft and other factors may vary, first stage performance also varies somewhat.\nUpper stage guidance is almost always closed loop, targeting a specific position and velocity combination. As a result, upper stages of boosters are shut down when that target is reached, with some amount of reserve propellants left to cover dispersions during ascent and a disposal burn.\nLiquid fueled first stages are not run dry. Cutoff is triggered with some amount left in the tank. This is because the turbopumps operate at ridiculous velocities and need something to pump, at a specific inlet pressure. The heat source (gas generator, expander, or preburner) that drives the pump is downstream of the inlet in the flow path, so cutoff has to happen by cutting off the drive force to the pump before the inlet loses pressure or runs dry. \nIf that pressure drops below minimum specifications or if the inlet goes dry, you will get cavitation and/or overspeed conditions, both of which would result in a violent reconfiguration of the hardware.\nSolid lower stages are much simpler in this regard.

Grammatical words that don't have any meaning on their own (function words?) like have to, going to (not present continuous), has, is, was, will etc., are highly susceptible to these sound changes. For instance, have to is often pronounced hafta, trying to is pronounced tryna, want to is wanna etc etc. The same thing happened to the phrase I'm going to.\n\nThere are a few processes involved in the reduction of I'm going to to ima.\n\n* I'm going to → I'm gonna: the consonant t is often dropped in many other clusters and grammatical constructions as well (as in tryna, wanna etc). Here it's dropped and the vowel of to—which is usually a schwa [ə]—is linked with the preceding word; going to → gonna: [ˈɡəʊɪ̃ŋtə] → [ˈgə̃nə]\n\n* Deletion of the /g/: plosives (/g t d k/ etc) require great effort to articulate (the air is completely blocked and then released), so people dropped the plosive /g/ to make its articulation easier: [aɪ̃m gə̃nə] → [aɪ̃m ə̃nə] (i'm ana)\n\n* linking I'm and gonna: In causal and connected speech, consonants and vowels are often linked by a process called liaison, so both I'm and gonna join together and become [aɪ̃mə̃nə] (i'mana).\n\n* Syncope of the vowel in the second syllable: Unstressed schwas are often lost through syncope (for example, 'chocolate' is choc.late for most speakers). If we removed the schwa from the second syllable, we'd get [aɪmnə] (i'mna).\n\n* Deletion of /n/: It's simple cluster reduction. In English, two nasals that are next to each other are often reduced to a single nasal (as in damn), so the /n/ is deleted, yielding in this case [aɪ̃mə] (i'ma). Or people dropped the /n/ for the sake of ease.\n\nSome people further reduce the diphthong [aɪ] it to something like [a], which results in [ãmə] (ama)\nThat's why people spell it that way. It's highly informal and as TypeIA pointed out in a comment, it's mostly a verbal thing and is not usually found in written form. It's commonly found in chatspeak or lolspeak.

    "input": "",
    "output": "Simple answer\nPixel shaders are tiny programs that can do operations on a single pixel on the screen, as opposed to geometry shaders and vertex shaders which work on the geometrical primitives (triangles) that make up everything you see on the screen. The most common use for pixel shaders is 'shading', approximation to real world lighting. Commonly used shading model is Phong.\nPixel shaders are executed on your video card, so your video card needs to support them. Each new version provides more capabilities, so an older video card will not run newer shaders. A new version of the pixel shader specification (e.g. Pixel Shader 3.0) is usually released for each new version of DirectX (more accurately, Direct3D).\nSoftware Requirements\nYou need to have the correct version of Direct3D (or OpenGL) installed in order to use the shaders. For example, Pixel Shader 4.0 requires at least Direct3D 10. Normally you don't have to worry about this, every game that uses Direct3D will install the correct version for you when you install the game. The only exceptions are Direct3D 10 and later, which will not run on Windows XP or earlier. You will need at least Windows Vista in order to play a game that uses Direct3D 10 or 11.\nWikipedia provides a nice list of Pixel Shader versions, the version of Direct3D you need, and the types of graphics cards that work with them.\n\nTechnical answer\nThe 'standard' stages of a 3D rendering pipeline are as follows (somewhat simplified):\n\n* Transformation (Moving, rotating and scaling all the objects in the scene)\n* Lighting\n* Projection ('Squashing' the 3D world into a 2D plane)\n* Clipping (Removing anything outside the field of view)\n* Rasterising (Converting the vector graphics (triangles, etc) into raster graphics (pixels))\n* Texturing\n* Display\n\nPixel Shaders are used as an alternative to the standard texturing phase. During rasterisation, each triangle is converted into pixels. These pixels do not have their final colour yet, but the do have a bunch of parameters associated with them. These include base colour, texture coordinates, lighting information, etc. The Pixel Shader is a small program that takes these parameters and uses them to calculate the final colour as it is displayed on the screen. The Pixel Shader has access to all texture data, and can use them to do interesting things such as blending two textures (to create a 'dirty' look), using a texture as a bump map (to simulate a relief), or to simulate reflections.\nHardware\nOn the hardware side, Pixel Shaders are executed on 'Shader Units', small processors on your GPU. Each Shader Unit is basically a very simple CPU, but a modern video card may contain thousands of these things (an AMD Radeon HD6990 contains over 3000). Older GPUs had different Shader Units for different tasks: Pixel Shaders were executed on different parts of the system than Vertex Shaders. Modern GPUs have so called 'unified shader units' which can perform all of these operations.",

(Useful in UI frameworks where the UI thread is where you are supposed to mess with UI elements)\nWe have two signatures we are considering:\n```std::future run_in_ui_thread( std::function ) // (A)\nstd::future run_in_ui_thread( std::function const& ) // (B)\n```\n\nNow, we are likely to use these as follows:\n```run_in_ui_thread( [=]{\n  // code goes here\n} ).wait();\n```\nwhich will create an anonymous closure (a lambda), construct a ```std::function``` out of it, pass it to the ```run_in_ui_thread``` function, then wait for it to finish running in the main thread.\nIn case (A), the ```std::function``` is directly constructed from our lambda, which is then used within the ```run_in_ui_thread```.  The lambda is ```move```d into the ```std::function```, so any movable state is efficiently carried into it.\nIn the second case, a temporary ```std::function``` is created, the lambda is ```move```d into it, then that temporary ```std::function``` is used by reference within the ```run_in_ui_thread```.\nSo far, so good -- the two of them perform identically.  Except the ```run_in_ui_thread``` is going to make a copy of its function argument to send to the ui thread to execute! (it will return before it is done with it, so it cannot just use a reference to it).  For case (A), we simply ```move``` the ```std::function``` into its long-term storage.  In case (B), we are forced to copy the ```std::function```.\nThat store makes passing by value more optimal.  If there is any possibility you are storing a copy of the ```std::function```, pass by value.  Otherwise, either way is roughly equivalent: the only downside to by-value is if you are taking the same bulky ```std::function``` and having one sub method after another use it.  Barring that, a ```move``` will be as efficient as a ```const&```.\nNow, there are some other differences between the two that mostly kick in if we have persistent state within the ```std::function```.\nAssume that the ```std::function``` stores some object with a ```operator() const```, but it also has some ```mutable``` data members which it modifies (how rude!).\nIn the ```std::function const&``` case, the ```mutable``` data members modified will propagate out of the function call.  In the ```std::function``` case, they won't.\nThis is a relatively strange corner case.\nYou want to treat ```std::function``` like you would any other possibly heavy-weight, cheaply movable type.

    "output": "ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC are two web frameworks developed by Microsoft - they are both good choices.  Neither of the web frameworks are to be replaced by the other nor are there plans to have them 'merged' into a single framework.  Continued support and development are done in parallel by Microsoft and neither will be 'going away'.\nEach of these web frameworks offers advantages/disadvantages - some of which need to be considered when developing a web application.  A web application can be developed using either technology - it might make development for a particular application easier selecting one technology versus the other and vice versa.\nASP.NET Web Forms:\n\n* Development supports state\n•   Gives the illusion that a web application is aware of what the user has been doing, similar to Windows applications.  I.e. Makes 'wizard' functionality a little bit easier to implement.  Web forms does a great job at hiding a lot of that complexity from the developer.\n* Rapid Application Development (RAD)\n•   The ability to just 'jump in' and start delivering web forms.  This is disputed by some of the MVC community, but pushed by Microsoft.  In the end, it comes down to the level of expertise of the developer and what they are comfortable with.  The web forms model probably has less of a learning curve to less experienced developers.\n* Larger control toolbox\n•   ASP.NET Web Forms offers a much greater and more robust toolbox (web controls) whereas MVC offers a more primitive control set relying more on rich client-side controls via jQuery (Javascript).\n* Mature\n•   It's been around since 2002 and there is an abundance of information with regards to questions, problems, etc.  Offers more third-party control - need to consider your existing toolkits.\n\nASP.NET MVC:\n\n* Separation of concerns (SoC)\n•   From a technical standpoint, the organization of code within MVC is very clean, organized and granular, making it easier (hopefully) for a web application to scale in terms of functionality.  Promotes great design from a development standpoint.\n* Easier integration with client side tools (rich user interface tools)\n•   More than ever, web applications are increasingly becoming as rich as the applications you see on your desktops.  With MVC, it gives you the ability to integrate with such toolkits (such as jQuery) with greater ease and more seamless than in Web Forms.\n* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Friendly / Stateless\n•   URL's are more friendly to search engines (i.e.  mywebapplication.com/users/ 1 - retrieve user with an ID of 1 vs mywebapplication/users/getuser.aspx (id passed in session)).  Similarly, since MVC is stateless, this removes the headache of users who spawn multiple web browsers from the same window (session collisions).  Along those same lines, MVC adheres to the stateless web protocol rather than 'battling' against it.\n* Works well with developers who need high degree of control\n•   Many controls in ASP.NET web forms automatically generate much of the raw HTML you see when an page is rendered.  This can cause headaches for developers.  With MVC, it lends itself better towards having complete control with what is rendered and there are no surprises.  Even more important, is that the HTML forms typically are much smaller than the Web forms which can equate to a performance boost - something to seriously consider.\n* Test Driven Development (TDD)\n•   With MVC, you can more easily  create tests for the web side of things.  An additional layer of testing will provide yet another layer of defense against unexpected behavior.\n\nAuthentication, authorization, configuration, compilation and deployment are all features that are shared between the two web frameworks.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "The higher you get, the lower the density of the air becomes. This lower density results in a lower lift being generated for the same airspeed and angle of attack. Effectively, the higher you fly the higher your minimum speed becomes. So while climbing, your speed needs to increase to compensate for the lower air density. As long a you can fly faster, the lower density at altitude can be compensated for. \nBasically there are two things that limit your maximum speed: thrust and speed of sound and with that your maximum altitude.\nFirst is thrust; the higher you get, the lower the thrust your engines deliver. You might note that drag goes down with the air density as well but since you are flying faster and faster during the climb the drag doesn't decrease at all. If your maximum altitude is limited by thrust then at some point during the climb the thrust and drag are getting close to equal and that is where the climb stops. When you can no longer climb with more than 100ft per minute (for propeller aircraft) or 500ft per minute (for jet / turbofan aircraft) you have reached your service ceiling. If the aircraft maximum altitude is determined by thrust, the absolute ceiling will take very long to reach. \nAt high altitudes air breathing engines will get difficulties eventually. Due to the lower air density the mass flow through the engine is reduced up to a point where it causes a flame out. \nThe other limitation is the speed of sound, at least for subsonic aircraft. In the process of generating lift, air flowing over the top of the wing is accelerated. At one point, when the aircraft is still flying below the speed of sound, shock waves will start to form over the wing. This results in increase of drag and reduces the lift. So provided you have enough engine power at your disposal you can climb to an altitude where your minimum speed is also your maximum speed. This is called the coffin corner. In the coffin corner:\n\n* if you fly any faster, you will exceed the maximum Mach number ($M_{mo}$) of your aircraft, resulting in high speed buffet, vibrations and possible loss of control. \n* if you fly any slower, the maximum lift that the wing can provide will be insufficient to maintain altitude. Descent or the aircraft will stall. \n* if you fly any higher and you will be too fast and too slow at the same time. \n* if you turn, you increase the wing loading, thereby increasing the minimum speed needed to create the required lift. Also the outer wing will easily exceed the maximum speed while at the same time the inner wing is below stall speed. This can quickly develop into a spin. \n\nSince accurate knowledge of engine performance, drag and wing characteristics of the aircraft is needed, there is not a simple formula to derive the maximum altitude for an aircraft.  \n\nApart from the aircraft performance related limitations above there is a certified maximum operating altitude for the pressurized cabin. This takes into account the structural properties of the hull (pressure difference between inside and outside) and the achievable emergency descent rate in case of a depressurization event.",

For translation lookup in i18n (see the gettext documentation for example), as in code like\n```raise forms.ValidationError(_(&quot;Please enter a correct username&quot;))\n```\n\n3. As a general purpose &quot;throwaway&quot; variable name:\n\n* To indicate that part of a function result is being deliberately ignored (Conceptually, it is being discarded.), as in code like:\n```label, has_label, _ = text.partition(':')\n```\n\n* As part of a function definition (using either ```def``` or ```lambda```), where the signature is fixed (e.g. by a callback or parent class API), but this particular function implementation doesn't need all of the parameters, as in code like:\n```def callback(_):\n    return True\n```\n\nThis use case can conflict with the translation lookup use case, so it is necessary to avoid using ```_``` as a throwaway variable in any code block that also uses it for i18n translation (many folks prefer a double-underscore, ```__```, as their throwaway variable for exactly this reason).\n\nLinters often recognize this use case. For example ```year, month, day = date()``` will raise a lint warning if ```day``` is not used later in the code. The fix, if ```day``` is truly not needed, is to write ```year, month, _ = date()```. Same with lambda functions, ```lambda arg: 1.0``` creates a function requiring one argument but not using it, which will be caught by lint. The fix is to write ```lambda _: 1.0```. An unused variable is often hiding a bug/typo (e.g. set ```day``` but use ```dya``` in the next line).\n\nThe pattern matching feature added in Python 3.10 elevated this usage from &quot;convention&quot; to &quot;language syntax&quot; where ```match``` statements are concerned: in match cases, ```_``` is a wildcard pattern, and the runtime doesn't even bind a value to the symbol in that case.\n\nFor other use cases, remember that ```_``` is still a valid variable name, and hence will still keep objects alive. In cases where this is undesirable (e.g. to release memory or external resources) an explicit ```del name``` call will both satisfy linters that the name is being used, and promptly clear the reference to the object.",

(Assuming a system with virtual memory.)  The effects are visible with performance experiments on Linux, for example.\nSome compilers even can optimize malloc + memset(0) into calloc for you, but it's best to just use calloc in the source if you want zeroed memory.  (Or if you were trying to pre-fault it to avoid page faults later, that optimization will defeat your attempt.)\nIf you aren't going to ever read memory before writing it, use ```malloc``` so it can (potentially) give you dirty memory from its internal free list instead of getting new pages from the OS.

It works well when the problem at hand easily decomposes into a sequence of standard operators and not so well otherwise.\n* Kotlin coroutines provide a language feature that let library writers implement various asynchronous programming styles, including, but not limited to functional reactive style (Rx).

Obviously this is true of any country, and even in democracies with strong human rights records, people with access to classified information are usually required to submit to strict scrutiny of their international travel. Given that they aren't concerned with human rights, dictatorships can take the easier option of restricting travel to any citizens.\nHowever, defection is really a piece of a bigger issue - oppressive regimes maintain their rule in part by controlling information. Here's an interesting article that talks about how dictatorships keep power. Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology program at George Washington University, is referenced:\n\n  Post said that in both Iraq and North Korea, dictators tightly controlled the flow of information. That control was upended in the past two years during the \"Arab spring\" revolts that swept away despots in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and some of the Gulf states, revolts that were encouraged in large part by information spread by cell phones and social media. \n\nNorth Korea is probably the most extreme example of information control (according to Reporters without Borders, they are dead last in Press Freedom in the world), but this can be seen in other oppressive regimes - for example, China attempts to limit access to \"wrong\" information via its Great Firewall.

A powerful involuntary mechanism\n  normally overrides voluntary breath‐holding and causes the breath that\n  defines the breakpoint.\n\nParkes explains that voluntary breath‐holding does not stop the central respiratory rhythm. Instead, breath holding merely suppresses its expression by voluntarily holding the chest at a certain volume. At the time of writing, no simple explanation for the break point existed. It is known to be caused by partial pressures of blood gases activating the carotid arterial chemoreceptors. They are peripheral sensory neurons that detect changes in chemical concentrations, including low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Both hypoxia and hypercapnia are signs of breath holding and both are detected by the chemoreceptors. These receptors send nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which eventually overrides the conscious breath holding.\n\nThe breaking point can be postponed by large lung inflations, hyperoxia and hypocapnia, and it is shortened by increased metabolic rates.\n\nReference\n- Parkes, Exp Physiol (2006); 91(1): 1-15",

You will usually see it coming out of the tail pipe when the engine and exhaust system of the vehicle is not completely warmed up. When it does become completely warmed up, you won't see it any more, because it comes out as steam (well, you'll see it in the winter time if it's cold enough, but you get the idea). ",

    "input": "",
    "output": "The whole idea behind the mail exchange (MX) record is to specify a host or hosts which can accept mail for a domain. As specified in RFC 1035, the MX record contains a domain name. It must therefore point to a host which itself can be resolved in the DNS. An IP address could not be used as it would be interpreted as an unqualified domain name, which cannot be resolved.\n\nThe reasons for this in the 1980s, when the specs were originally written, are almost the same as the reasons for it today: A host may be connected to multiple networks and use multiple protocols.\n\nBack in the 80s, it was not uncommon to have mail gateways which connected both to the (relatively new) Internet which used TCP/IP and to other legacy networks, which often used other protocols. Specifying MX in this way allowed for DNS records which could identify how to reach such a host on a network other than the Internet, such as Chaosnet. In practice, though, this almost never happened; virtually everyone re-engineered their networks to become part of the Internet instead.\n\nToday, the situation is that a host may be reached by multiple protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) and by multiple IP addresses in each protocol. A single MX record can't possibly list more than one address, so the only option is to point to a host, where all of that host's addresses can then be looked up. (As a performance optimization, the DNS server will send along the address records for the host in the response additional section if it has authoritative records for them, saving a round trip.)\n\nThere is also the situation that arises when your mail exchangers are provided by a third party (e.g. Google Apps or Office 365). You point your MX records to their hostnames, but it may occur that the service provider needs to change the mail servers' IP addresses. Since you have pointed to a host, the service provider can do this transparently and you don't have to make any changes to your records.",

As you said, there are usually high fees at the big airports, so landing at a smaller satellite airport can often save you money and save you time because you won't have to taxi as far or sit and wait in line to get out. An extra 15 minutes by car can be better than an extra 30 minutes while taxiing. \n\nAs far as being prepared, it isn't really much different than smaller airports other than the fact that ATC is much busier.

When they rattle off taxi instructions like \"Cessna N1234, taxi to the ramp via Alpha, Tango, Echo, and Xray.

Fuzzy string matching is, itself, a fuzzy science, and so by creating linearly independent metrics for measuring string similarity, and having a known set of strings we wish to match to each other, we can find the parameters that, for our specific styles of strings, give the best fuzzy match results.\n\nTo allow the optimization of fuzzy matching, we can weight each metric. The formula that defines the final score is a simply combination of the metrics and their weights: \n```\nvalue = Min(phraseWeight*phraseValue, wordsWeight*wordsValue)*minWeight\n      + Max(phraseWeight*phraseValue, wordsWeight*wordsValue)*maxWeight\n      + lengthWeight*lengthValue\n```\n\nFor your specific context, you have to come up with a set of weights for any metrics you come up with to determine similarity. With the appropriate set of heuristics and weights, you'll have your comparison program quickly making the decisions that you would have made.",

However, you don't get a torque from spinning a reaction wheel at constant angular velocity but by changing and accelerating that angular velocity.\n\nNow the torque imparted on the helicopter by the air through the main rotor is steady - or at least its of roughly constant direction. Therefore, to counter that torque, the reaction wheel would have to accelerated uniformly and indefinitely. Clearly this is impossible from an engineering standpoint.\n\nYou can also think of this from a conservation of angular momentum, without thinking about the origin of the torques. The air imparts a steady angular impulse to the helicopter. Therefore, the helicopter system's angular momentum must increase steadily (unless there's a countering torque from the tailfan).

I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20°C (-4°F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold.

In his words, he \"neglected etymological rules\". \n\nIn that same year, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science began developing a coherent system of electrical units, the cgs system. Varley, a committee member, liked Clark's proposal, but he advocated adding a French name such as Ampere, to facilitate the international acceptance of the new units (\"I should like to introduce a French name into the list. We have Germany, England and Italy represented\"). For the same reason he may have pleaded for not distorting the French and German names. In addition, Varley objected to the galvat \"because Galvani discovered next to nothing\".\n\nLatimer Clark adapted the unit names in his 'Elementary treatise on electrical measurement' (1868). He changed ohma to ohm, and dropped the galvat. Maxwell acknowledged Clark's practical units and their names in his 'Treatise on electricity and magnetism' (1873). In 1881, at the International Electrical Congress in Paris), two French names, ampere and coulomb, were added. The diplomacy worked, and the new system of electrical units was adopted by all countries. The only units that kept the initial name distortion were the volt and the farad.",

These are the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$ and the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk \\cdots}$. Contracting two vectors with these symbols yields the dot and cross products, respectively (the latter only works in three dimensions). Since the laws of physics appear to be isotropic (i.e. rotationally invariant), it makes sense that any physically useful method for combining physical quantities like vectors together should be isotropic as well. The dot and cross products turn out to be the only two possible multilinear options.\n\nWhy multilinear maps are so useful in physics is an even deeper and more fundamental question, but which answers to that question are satisfying is probably inherently a matter of opinion.",

American animators and animation enthusiasts often times scorn the Japanese styles and methods of animation as lazy, while Japanese anime enthusiasts deride the American style as clunky or too comical.\n\nWhy is that you ask? The answer lies in how these countries distribute their budget and time. \n\nWhile American animation often times may seem lacking in it's attention to detail, it makes up for it the quality of their animation. American animation often times meticulous and original in how they animate motion, though sometimes content is reused cyclically, the animation is painstakingly frame by frame. \n\nIn contrast, Japanese anime uses a lot of shortcuts (to save budget and meet deadlines). Typically long scenes feature only the mouth of a character (and maybe other minor features like a waving hair or glittering eyes) moving during delivery of key information/dialog, or the short burst of motion of some character in some an action pose against an animated, cyclic, and stylized background (I'm looking at you transformation scenes). Often times these uses of dramatic still-shots are done against patterned (or static illustrated) backgrounds, sometimes a few moving emotive icons (sweat drops, question marks, small chibi animated heads) will accompany a some sort of monologue. Admittedly both styles of animation reuse shots and sequences, but it's more noticeable in Japanese anime for various reason (e.g., not enough budget and/or manpower). This is why Japanese anime is typically labeled as \"lazy\" by American animators and enthusiasts.\n\nA typical walk cycle in animation consists of 8 keyframes typically:\n\nThe smoothness of an animation is typically determined by the framerate and amount of key frames in the animation. \nIn American animation, the animation is captured by shooting two frames of film per drawing at a rate of 24 frames per second (fps) to achieve the smooth motion of American animation. \nJapanese anime, while it also runs at an average 24 fps, typically captures their animation at a rate of three or four frames per drawing in order to save money and manpower. Though it varies depending on the studio and tools used (e.g 3DCG) with main objects in the foreground (typically characters) are animated at 8 to 12 fps, while background objects can be animated at as low as 6 to 8 fps.\n\nLets compare the difference between one walk cycle that is 8 frame to one that is 16 frames, both at 60 fps:\n  \nNotice the 16 frame one is smoother, but slower while the 8 frame is faster, but choppier. This is because it takes the 16 frame animation twice as long, covering more frames, to go through one cycle than the 8 frame one.\nThe varying of frame rates can also be be used to depict the expansion and compression of time (think bullet time from The Matrix). However generally choppy animation is the result of not enough keyframes in your animation. More frames mean more and manpower and/or time, which ultimately means more money is required. Japanese anime production don't typically have as big of a budget compared to American productions (but there are exceptions), so they must make do with what they have and cut corners where they can (like Shaft did with the certain Bakemonogatari TV episodes).",

In any event, John the Baptist himself directly denied the claim (see John 1:19-21). \nWhat Jesus more likely was saying in Matthew 11 is that John the Baptist was a prophet in the tradition of Elijah. Elijah was the greatest of the prophets (even if his disciple Elisha inherited a double portion of his spirit). All of the prophets that followed came in the name and spirit of Elijah, in the same way that some of Paul's letters apparently were created after his death. They were in the spirit and tradition even if not the actual man. \nNote also Elijah never died - he was taken up into heaven, and people thought he would return. As such, no Elijah was not being thought to have reincarnated- only returned. Elijah's return was long a part of Jewish custom. Even today, during a Passover sedar, a chair is left empty for Elijah. But again, since he did not die, Jews look for his return, not his reincarnation. \n\nFaulty Premise #2: The Jewish world view has  any concept of reincarnation at all\n\nThe most basic rule of hermeneutics suggests that a text cannot mean what it could not mean to the original audience. If the Jews had no concept of reincarnation, then any interpretation that says it does has a very, very high bar to clear.\nIn his book The Gift of the Jews, Thomas Cahill advances the thesis that the primary distinctive philosophy of the Jews was precisely that history was not circular. Their linear idea of a human life was a departure from others and was an explicit rejection of reincarnation. As such, a text would need to be exceedingly explicit to a culture that rejected circular life patterns, and the obscure interpretation above (especially in light of the more obvious intepretation) simply doesn't hold water.\nFurthermore, the book of Hebrews - written to the people into which both Jesus and John the Baptist were born - explicitly reject reincarnation. As the writer points out in 9:27, \n\n  It is appointed unto a man once to die and then the judgement.\n\nHere we do have an explicit rejection of reincarnation by the followers of Jesus. There is one death. There is one judgement. Hence, in any Christian worldview, you don't come back.",

Writers like Johannes Schlaf, who wrote \"Das Dritte Reich\" in 1899, or the German translator of Ibsen's \"The Emperor and the Galilean\", popularized the idea of the imminent arrival of a thousand years of Christianity (a kind of positive apocalypse), which would follow a third \"Reich\". And they would quote Paul the Apostle and various saints, to make it clear that the third Reich would follow the heretic lex naturalis and the lex mosaica. \n\nNazi propagandists exploited this in their articles, making it sound as if the saints had had some sort of epiphany about Hitler and the Nazis.\n\nIn other words, the Third Reich began as an abstract idea of a Christian revolution, but was assumed by Nazi writers in order to bolster Hitler's popularity and justify the drastic and bloody decisions that the Fascist government was making.\n\nIn one of the earliest examples of the Third Reich being mentioned outside of Germany, Major Strasser in the film Casablanca talks about the Third Reich as if it was just the beginning to a kind of paradisaical future or of a fourth Reich.\n\nAfter 1945, the term was used exclusively to associate only to the unsuccessful reign of Fascism in Germany, and it ceased as a philosophical or theological idea in German literary circles.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Basically, a fold or crease in paper will remain because the structure of the fibers in the paper have become irreversibly damaged. This happens because the paper is bent/compressed beyond its elastic limit.\n\nChemically, paper is mainly composed of cellulose  from plant fibers. Cellulose is an organic polymer, which has D-glucose units connected through hydrogen bonds. These bonds form between the oxygen atom of the one-hydroxyl group belonging to the glucose and the hydrogen atom of the next glucose unit. These are microscopic properties of paper, but to understand what happens when we fold paper or do Origami, it is sufficient to learn what is happening macroscopically.\n\nAll materials have what is called an elastic limit and a plastic region. The elastic limit is the point at which a material will bend but still return to its original position without any permanent change or damage to its structure. Further deforming the material beyond this limit takes it to its plastic region. At this point any structural or physical changes become permanent and the paper will not return to its original form.\n\nEvery material has a different elastic limit or yield, and plastic region. Imagine holding a piece of paper slightly bent but not folding or creasing it. The plant fibers that make up the paper will not have exceeded their elastic limit. So as soon as you let go of the paper sheet it will quickly return to its noncreased original flat state. However, if you were to roll that piece of paper into a cylinder and hold it for a few minutes, some of these fibers will be pushed beyond the elastic limit which is evident since it will not lie flat anymore since slight deformations have occurred in this sheet.\n\nNow, when you properly fold a piece of paper as you would during Origami, the plant fibers along the crease are pushed into the plastic region of the paper, causing a fracture point at the actual line of the fold. A practical example of this is if you were to fold a piece of paper, you will note that if you stretch the paper evenly on both sides of the fold, the paper will tear right on the fold (a quick way to &quot;cut&quot; paper if you have no scissors). The fold then becomes an irreversible structural failure and the fibers in the paper will never regain their original state.\n\nBecause of this damage to its structure, the paper will from then on have this fold. And no matter how hard you try to flatten out the fold it will never return to its original state. This is why Origami models continually retain their shape.",

Why didn't they choose the simple way out and use function defining keyword?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Dennis Ritchie’s paper on The Development of the C Language gives some idea of the reasoning behind this: namely, the fundamental rule in C that declaration syntax should match expression syntax\"\n\nFor each object of such a composed type, there was already a way to mention the underlying object: index the array, call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer. Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear. Thus,\n```int i, *pi, **ppi;\n```\ndeclare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a pointer to an integer. The syntax of these declarations reflects the observation that ```i```, ```*pi```, and ```**ppi``` all yield an ```int``` type when used in an expression. Similarly,\n```int f(), *f(), (*f)();\n```\ndeclare a function returning an integer, a function returning a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning an integer;\n```int *api[10], (*pai)[10];\n```\ndeclare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to an array of integers. In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.\n\n\nIt appears this rule trumped parser considerations. Its immediate consequence is that function declarations can’t use specific keywords, or impose a different ordering of declaration components.\nIt’s worth noting that parsing was somewhat different in early C, since function declarations didn’t specify their arguments, and function definitions separated the argument list from the argument declarations (which weren’t necessary for ```int``` arguments):\n```sum();\n```\ndeclares a ```sum``` function, which would then be defined as\n```sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n(no types needed here, the default is ```int```).

But here's some more general advice, which also applies in this situation: In cases such as this, always create your own shortcut macro, say\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\n\nThis way, if you ever decide that that curly L is not quite the one you like, it is easy to switch. Also, even before you knew the answer to this question, you could have written\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{L}\n```\nin your preamble. Then you could start/continue writing the document, use ordinary capital Ls where you want, and ```\\Lagr``` wherever you actually mean a Lagrangian, and then later changing the definition of ```\\Lagr``` to something appropriate. This way, you wouldn't have to manually search for each occurence of a capital L and decide if it's a Lagrangian or not. Clearly ```\\Lagr``` (or whatever you want to call this macro) is also easier to type than ```\\mathcal{L}```, and it makes the source code much more readable.\n\nAnother advantage, which is probably more subtle, since you're new to LaTeX, is that we can make the curvy L exactly the type of math we want. TeX distinguishes between ordinary letters, binary operators, binary relations, opening and closing parenthesis and so on; the spacing between two ordinary letters is not the same as the spacing between the ```a```, ```+```, and ```b``` in ```$a+b$```. So since the Lagrangian is a kind of operator, we could say\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{\\mathop{\\mathcal{L}}}\n```\n\nBut in the case of operators, the package amsmath (which you are most likely using; if not, you should) provides a somewhat better mechanism:\n```\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\n\nAnother (related) tip: Even if you are using the same notation for two different things, it is best to make a separate macro for each. In this case you might have\n```\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lapl}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\nThe reason is the same as in the ```L``` vs. ```\\Lagr``` case above: If you at some point decide that using ```\\mathcal{L}``` for both is a bad idea, you would have to find each occurence of ```\\Lagr``` and figure out if it is really a Laplacian.

    "output": "There are 2 good reasons for this. \n\nFirst, a TT bike is the most efficient machine for flat, fast course racing, where there are a minimum of hills. It is not the most efficient machine when it comes to climbing. The body position is far too aggressive for even professional athletes to use in a non-TT style event. A bike with more a more upright body position, a more stable weight distribution, a lighter frame, and far, far lighter wheels, is a more efficient choice for that style of ride.\n\nSecondly, a TT bike sacrifices bike handling for that extreme power and aero efficiency. The TT stages are controlled events, where there are either one rider, or one team on the course at a time, and so limitations on stability and handling are acceptable. Take the same bike in a 150 rider peloton, where riders constantly jockey for position, and where even on a stable bike losing focus for 1 second can cause a major crash, and all of a sudden, those same sacrifices in bike handling and stability are no longer a benefit for the rider or the team. They become a hazard to the team's chances of winning. And not just for the stage or the day, since a bad crash can take a rider out for the season. \n\nOr God forbid, permanently. \nFor these reasons, the UCI has seen fit to ban the bikes in non-TT events, in order to ensure rider safety. And for once, their decision makes sense.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "In Arabic, in fact, they've always been separate sounds! The sound we write \"K\" is spelled with the letter ك in Arabic, and is pronounced a little bit further forward in the mouth; the sound we write \"Q\" is spelled with the letter ق and pronounced a little bit farther back. In phonetic terms, \"K\" is a velar sound, and \"Q\" is a uvular sound.\n\nEnglish doesn't distinguish between these two different sounds. But since we've got a spare letter lying around—the English letter \"Q\" is actually related to the Arabic letter ق, if you go back far enough!—it's become conventional to separate them in writing. \"Kuwait\" is spelled with a ك, so it gets a \"K\"; \"Qatar\" is spelled with a ق, so it gets a \"Q\". The \"Qur'an\", similarly, has a ق in it.\n\nNowadays, by the way, the letter \"Q\" has started to be associated with Arabic in particular, since it shows up significantly more there than in English. So in pop culture, you'll sometimes see names like \"Hakeem\" respelled to \"Haqim\"—even though the original Arabic has a ك in it! Linguistically, this is called hypercorrection, and it's the same reason you'll see words like \"forté\" with an é: English-speakers associate the acute accent with Romance loans (café, fiancé, résumé), but it has no special meaning in English, so it sometimes gets inserted where it doesn't actually belong (the original Italian word is simply forte).",

É muito mais fácil dividir arquivos entre servidores diferentes do que distribuir registros de uma tabela em mais servidores.\n* Flexibilidade: fazer cópias de segurança, mover arquivos de um servidor para outro, fazer algum processamento nos arquivos armazenados, tudo isso fica mais fácil se os arquivos estiverem num diretório.

Therefore it is highly stress tested.  It relies on the fact that fear will set in in order to use your natural responses and turn them into functional movements to your advantage. It relies heavily on shock and awe in that defence and attack should be simultaneous where possible to capitalise on the opponent's shock value.\n\nSystema is - in many ways - the exact opposite, it is a system which teaches over a much longer period of time how to control your fear/anger/pity and teaches relaxation (through breathing/stretching) in stressful situations so that attacks on your person are less effective, better recovered from and the pressure points, levers and momentum of attackers can be manipulated to your advantage using the clarity of mind gained from your training.\n\nIn Summary\nSo in effect Krav Maga is taught fast and turns your weaknesses into strengths so your defence/attack becomes like a reflex just when you need it, while Systema is a methodology that needs to be learned and seeks to remove those weaknesses so that your defense/attacks can be more effective.\n\nAlso, another martial art, similar and somewhere between these is the Keysi Fighting Method (KFM) - developed for street fighting - but that has some actual forms that have to be learned such as the very distinctive 'Pensador' that the Christian Bale Batman uses/\n\nKFM is a lot more like Krav Maga but it makes heavy use of the 'Pensador' guard (much like the 'Rhino' Krav pose) and concentrates a much larger chunk of its time to dealing with multiple opponents and ground based fighting, as it was developed for street fighting and this is where they tend to end up.

This means that it is relatively trivial to root the device, and there are actually multiple ways it can be done, such as:\n\n* Flashing a system image with root tools built in\n* Flashing a boot image that runs ```adbd``` with root by default (an \"unsecure\" image)\n* Flashing a recovery image, then using that to overwrite the system or boot partitions with ones that allow root access\n\nOnce root is obtained, all of the information on ```/data``` essentially becomes accessible.

    "input": "",
    "output": "> The original IBM PC and later variants used an Intel 8253 or 8254 as a sound chip.\n\nThe 8253 is a timer circuit, containing three timers able to generate timed interrupts or square-wave output with programmed frequencies. On the PC the third timer's output is, via an amplifier, connected to a simple speaker.\n\nAs said before, calling a 'simple' timer a sound chip is quite a stretch. \nSince it's a digital output, no level control is available. Only on or off is possible. At best this results in rather nasty sounding square waves. There is no provision to smooth the signal (beside the inertia of the speaker membrane).\n\nAlso, the only frequencies that can be selected are those that result from dividing the base frequency (1,193,181.8 Hz) by an integer in the range of 1&ndash;65535. So even when accepting the meager signal quality, only very few notes can be played at correct frequency. Already the basic 440 Hz concert pitch will be off by .5Hz. So whatever is played using the timer will sound off pitch. Music can still sound good if a little off pitch, but only when all notes are off in the same way (*1) - which is not the case with this 'sound chip'.\n\nOf course, there are also ways to manipulate the sound even a bit better by manually handling the output - which results in 100% CPU time usage.\n\n> Why did users add sound cards such as the Adlib or Sound Blaster.\n\nSimply because they wanted sound - or at least music. Not just a beeper.\n\n> What was lacking with the original PC sound chip?\n\nAs said before, it's no sound chip at all. A sound chip will need programmable oscillators for different wave forms and at least some analogue ciruitry to make a smooth, more natural sound. Ofcourse, from an enginering point, the PC's use of a timer was a great improvement over the Apple II, its model and competition, as it allowed the beeping in parallel - not that this feature was used by BIOS or DOS.\nLast but not least, the PC is an open system. It is made to add new/better hardware. So why shoudn't there be a real sound card? Improving the machine is a core feature of the design.\n\nAddendum:\nagtoever added a comment with a great example of what was possible with the direct fiddling with the speaker. Awesome, but less than apealing when compared to even the cheapest form of soundcard, the AdLib of the same time, as used by Monkey Island. Next to zero CPU usage and crisp clear sound. Not to mention easy programming. I'd call that a huge advantage.\n\n*1 - The average human decodes frequencies relative to each other. As a result sound is still perceived as good, even if the whole scale is shifted, as long as it's in the same direction and same percentage. Output needs to be way off to be noticed by an average listener. In contrast, if notes are off by a different margin and in different directions, even less trained listeners will notice.",

While there are multiple ways of doing it, you can imagine a trivial (not optimal) solution could be like this (simplified for the specific case of ```std::function<int (double)>``` for the sake of simplicity):\n```struct callable_base {\n   virtual int operator()(double d) = 0;\n   virtual ~callable_base() {}\n};\ntemplate <typename F>\nstruct callable : callable_base {\n   F functor;\n   callable(F functor) : functor(functor) {}\n   virtual int operator()(double d) { return functor(d); }\n};\nclass function_int_double {\n   std::unique_ptr<callable_base> c;\npublic:\n   template <typename F>\n   function(F f) {\n      c.reset(new callable<F>(f));\n   }\n   int operator()(double d) { return c(d); }\n// ...\n};\n```\nIn this simple approach the ```function``` object would store just a ```unique_ptr``` to a base type. For each different functor used with the ```function```, a new type derived from the base is created and an object of that type instantiated dynamically. The ```std::function``` object is always of the same size and will allocate space as needed for the different functors in the heap.\nIn real life there are different optimizations that provide performance advantages but would complicate the answer. The type could use small object optimizations, the dynamic dispatch can be replaced by a free-function pointer that takes the functor as argument to avoid one level of indirection, but the idea is basically the same.\n\nRegarding the issue of how copies of the ```std::function``` behave, a quick test indicates that copies of the internal callable object are done, rather than sharing the state.\n```// g++4.8\nint main() {\n   int value = 5;\n   typedef std::function<void()> fun;\n   fun f1 = [=]() mutable { std::cout << value++ << '\\n' };\n   fun f2 = f1;\n   f1();                    // prints 5\n   fun f3 = f1;\n   f2();                    // prints 5\n   f3();                    // prints 6 (copy after first increment)\n}\n```\nThe test indicates that ```f2``` gets a copy of the callable entity, rather than a reference.

It sounds like the first meeting you attended was Priesthood meeting where the brothers study the words of scripture and modern Church leaders. Those classes usually have a single instructor each week.\n\nSacrament meeting is where any equivalence of a sermon would be heard. The primary difference between Mormon services and some others is the focal event of church meetings. The purpose behind holding a sacrament meeting is to take the sacrament and renew covenants made at baptism. The actual administration of the sacrament is the most sacred public meeting to Mormons. Hearing people speak and even interpersonal communion (socializing) is only secondary, though important.\n\nMembers of a ward, or local congregation, are invited to speak by the bishop or his counselors (the basic equivalent of a pastor) and will have some time to prepare a talk. Talks should draw from the scriptures, personal experience and testimony, and focus on the Savior. Note that comments made by church members over the pulpit at a sacrament meeting do not necessarily reflect the Church's official position on a topic or even Church doctrine.\nThe talks are meant to urge, inspire, and exhort all in attendance to come to Christ, to give them an opportunity to feel the power of the Spirit, and to strengthen their faith. Often, members will come with questions in their hearts and find answers in the words that day.\n\nCounsel from leaders like a bishop sometimes occur over the pulpit, but usually this is private and individual, based on personal circumstances. The bishop and his counselors are supposed to meet with members regularly in interviews. There is no paid clergy, so all the service is volunteer.\n\nEach member is also assigned two \"home teachers\" which visit their family once a month to share a gospel message, check on well-being, and be a friend and support especially when needed. In this way, instruction is given which might also help replace a typical sermon pattern. The bishop, his counselors, and others he calls on help organize these efforts. (It has also proven to be very quick and effective during disaster response, as home teachers immediately report in on who they teach, and bishops coordinate an effort if needed.\n\nSo what you saw was apparently quite normal. Even once a month (the first Sunday), a fast and testimony meeting is held during sacrament meeting, where members forgo preparing talks and instead bear their testimonies about Christ and the gospel for the hour as they feel a desire to do so.

    "input": "",
    "output": "There are a number of well-studied strategies; which is best in your application depends on circumstance.\n\n* Improve worst case runtime\nUsing problem-specific insight, you can often improve the naive algorithm. For instance, there are $O(c^n)$ algorithms for Vertex Cover with $c huge improvement over the naive $\\Omega(2^n)$ and might make instance sizes relevant for you tractable.\n\n* Improve expected runtime\nUsing heuristics, you can often devise algorithms that are fast on many instances. If those include most that you meet in practice, you are golden. Examples are SAT for which quite involved solvers exist, and the Simplex algorithm (which solves a polynomial problem, but still). One basic technique that is often helpful is branch and bound.\n\n* Restrict the problem\nIf you can make more assumptions on your inputs, the problem may become easy.\n\n* Structural properties\nYour inputs may have properties that simplify solving the problem, e.g. planarity, bipartiteness or missing a minor for graphs. See here for some examples of graph classes for which CLIQUE is easy.  \n\n* Bounding functions of the input\nAnother thing to look at is parameterised complexity; some problems are solvable in time $O(2^kn^m)$ for $k$ some instance parameter (maximum node degree, maximum edge weight, ...) and $m$ constant. If you can bound $k$ by a polylogarithmic function in $n$ in your setting, you get polynomial algorithms. Saeed Amiri gives details in his answer.\n\n* Bounding input quantities\nFurthermore, some problems admit algorithms that run in pseudo-polynomial time, that is their runtime is bounded by a polynomial function in a number that is part of the input; the naive primality check is an example. This means that if the quantities encoded in your instances have reasonable size, you might have simple algorithms that behave well for you.\n\n* Weaken the result\nThis means that you tolerate errorneous or incomplete results. There are two main flavors:\n\n* Probabilistic algorithms\nYou only get the correct result with some probability. There are some variants, most notable Monte-Carlo and Las-Vegas algorithms. A famous example is the Miller-Rabin primality test.\n\n* Approximation algorithms\nYou no longer look for optimal solutions but almost optimal ones. Some algorithms admit relative (\"no worse than double the optimum\"), others absolute (\"no worse than $5$ plus the optimum\") bounds on the error. For many problems it is open how well they can be approximated. There are some that can be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time, while others are known to not allow that; check the theory of polynomial-time approximation schemes.\n\nRefer to Algorithmics for Hard Problems by Hromkovič for a thorough treatment.\n* Simplicity is beauty: Improved upper bounds for vertex cover by Chen Jianer, Iyad A.

The lights are usually adjusted at dusk, night or dawn to match the exterior environment.\n\nIf the cabin lights do not fail during an emergency, the dimmed light also makes it easier to identify the \"EXIT\" signs which illuminate and make the guidance lighting on the floor easier to follow. The bright emergency lighting is more prominent to identify when the cabin light is dimmed, saving valuable seconds as the aircraft is evacuated.\n\nThis also ties in with having to raise the blinds on the windows. The blinds need to be raised during take-off and landing irrespective of the outside light situation, however, with a darker cabin, any outside light source, especially from fires or other hazards is easier to identify by the crew, making the decision process of whether one side could be inappropriate to use for evacuation faster, e.g. fire on port side --> no evacuation on that side.\n\nThe blinds are therefore raised to allow a better view for cabin crew of the outside area and external aircraft parts, such as engines, wings, etc.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "There are 3 main ways to perform a case-insensitive search in Oracle without using full-text indexes.\n\nUltimately what method you choose is dependent on your individual circumstances; the main thing to remember is that to improve performance you must index correctly for case-insensitive searching.\n\n1. Case your column and your string identically.\nYou can force all your data to be the same case by using `UPPER()` or `LOWER()`:\n```\nselect * from my_table where upper(column_1) = upper('my_string');\n```\nor\n```\nselect * from my_table where lower(column_1) = lower('my_string');\n```\nIf `column_1` is not indexed on `upper(column_1)` or `lower(column_1)`, as appropriate, this may force a full table scan. In order to avoid this you can create a function-based index.\n```\ncreate index my_index on my_table ( lower(column_1) );\n```\nIf you're using LIKE then you have to concatenate a `%` around the string you're searching for.\n```\nselect * from my_table where lower(column_1) LIKE lower('my_string') || '%';\n```\n\n2. Use regular expressions.\nFrom Oracle 10g onwards `REGEXP_LIKE()` is available. You can specify the _match_parameter_ `'i'`, in order to perform case-insensitive searching.\n\nIn order to use this as an equality operator you must specify the start and end of the string, which is denoted by the carat and the dollar sign.\n\n```\nselect * from my_table where regexp_like(column_1, '^my_string$', 'i');\n```\nIn order to perform the equivalent of LIKE, these can be removed.\n```\nselect * from my_table where regexp_like(column_1, 'my_string', 'i');\n```\nBe careful with this as your string may contain characters that will be interpreted differently by the regular expression engine.\n\n3. Change it at the session level.\nThe NLS_SORT parameter governs the collation sequence for ordering and the various comparison operators, including `=` and LIKE. You can specify a binary, case-insensitive, sort by altering the session. This will mean that every query performed in that session will perform case-insensitive parameters.\n```\nalter session set nls_sort=BINARY_CI\n```\nThere's plenty of additional information around linguistic sorting and string searching if you want to specify a different language, or do an accent-insensitive search using BINARY_AI.\n\nYou will also need to change the NLS_COMP parameter; the default value of NLS_COMP is BINARY; but, LINGUISTIC specifies that Oracle should pay attention to the value of NLS_SORT.\n\nSo, once again, you need to alter the session\n```\nalter session set nls_comp=LINGUISTIC\n```\nYou may want to create a linguistic index to improve performance\n```\ncreate index my_linguistc_index on my_table \n   (NLSSORT(column_1, 'NLS_SORT = BINARY_CI'));\n```",

Should I keep them separate? Any help here will be appreciated and might lead to a set of guidelines for the community.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "TL;DR If you have very simple scenarios, like a single client application, a single API then it might not pay off to go OAuth 2.0. On the other hand, if there are lots of different clients (browser-based, native mobile, server-side, etc) then sticking to OAuth 2.0 rules might make it more manageable than trying to roll your own system.\n\n## Detailed Answer\n\nJWT (Learn JSON Web Tokens) is just a token format. It defines a compact and self-contained mechanism for transmitting data between parties in a way that can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Additionally, the encoding rules of a JWT also make these tokens very easy to use within the context of HTTP.\n\nBeing self-contained (the actual token contains information about a given subject), they are also a good choice for implementing stateless authentication mechanisms (aka Look mum, no sessions!). When going this route, the only thing a party must present to be granted access to a protected resource is the token itself, and the token in question can be called a bearer token.\n\nIn practice, what you're doing can already be classified as bearer token -based. However, do consider you're not using bearer tokens as specified by the OAuth 2.0 related specs (see RFC 6750). That would imply relying on the Authorization HTTP header and using the Bearer authentication scheme.\n\nRegarding the use of the JWT to prevent CSRF: Without knowing exact details it's difficult to ascertain the validity of that practice. To be honest, it does not seem correct and/or worthwhile. The following article (Cookies vs Tokens: The Definitive Guide) may be a useful read on this subject, particularly the XSS and XSRF Protection section.\n\nOne final piece of advice. Even if you don't need to go full OAuth 2.0, I would strongly recommend on passing your access token within the Authorization header instead of going with custom headers. If they are really bearer tokens, follow the rules of RFC 6750. If not, you can always create a custom authentication scheme and still use that header.",

Early societies were naturally regulated just as animal population are - by food resources. When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage. Modern humanity has no place to move - all land is already claimed by someone, so we have to make do with what resources we have - and consequently affects the world at global scale, which earlier cultures were incapable of.\n\nSustainability is not about return to pre-industrial way of life - it is unsustainable at modern population levels.

Evading the elements: Hiking throughout the night and resting in the day can be especially useful in hot, arid conditions. For example in deserts, extreme heat during the day and severe cold in the night often come together. Hiking during the night here serves the double purpose of keeping you active and warm when it is cold while allowing you to save water resources during the day.\n\n3.

Most people travel during the day and one of the reasons we (or at least, I) get outdoors is to enjoy some quietness in the wild.

And they do all their fighting with swords. \n\nThe lists go on and on. Science fiction and fantasy are united in that they explore the impossible.

Whereas PrPC is soluble in most detergents and can be easily digested by proteases, PrPScis insoluble in detergents and maintains a protease-resistant core, designated PrP27-30, which polymerizes into amyloid (25).\n\nDr. Neena Singh also discovered that prions &quot;piggyback&quot; or attach to another protein called ferritin, as they make their way through the digestive system:\n\nDisease-causing prions are thought to have passed into people when they ate beef from infected cattle, triggering the brain wasting condition called new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or vCJD. But researchers have not been sure exactly how prions enter the body.\nTo find out, Neena Singh and her team at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, mimicked the process of eating and digesting infected meat.\nThey mashed up brain tissue that contained prions from patients who had a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They then exposed it to a range of harsh digestive enzymes from the mouth, stomach and intestine, which normally break proteins into pieces.\nPrions, which are known to be enormously tough, escape this attack almost unscathed, they showed, as does a second type of protein called ferritin, which stores iron and is abundant in meat. The two proteins seem to stick together, they report in the Journal of Neuroscience.\nThe researchers next added the digested slurry to a lab model of the human gut: a growing sheet of cells from the intestinal lining. By attaching fluorescent tags to the two proteins, they showed that they are transported through the cells hand-in-hand. &quot;Prions probably ride piggyback&quot; through the gut wall into the body, Singh says.\n\nAttaching to ferritin may provide additional protection from digestion, insofar as this removes prions from the digestive system, where proteases are concentrated.",

So, the difference between `stop` and `start` is the number of elements selected (if `step` is 1, the default).\n\nThe other feature is that `start` or `stop` may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:\n```\na[-1]    # last item in the array\na[-2:]   # last two items in the array\na[:-2]   # everything except the last two items\n```\nSimilarly, `step` may be a negative number:\n```\na[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed\na[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed\na[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed\na[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed\n```\n\nPython is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for ```a[:-2]``` and ```a``` only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error. Sometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware that this may happen.\n\n## Relationship with the ```slice``` object\n\nA slice object can represent a slicing operation, i.e.:\n```\na[start:stop:step]\n```\nis equivalent to:\n```\na[slice(start, stop, step)]\n```\n\nSlice objects also behave slightly differently depending on the number of arguments, similarly to ```range()```, i.e. both ```slice(stop)``` and ```slice(start, stop[, step])``` are supported. To skip specifying a given argument, one might use ```None```, so that e.g. ```a[start:]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(start, None)]``` or ```a[::-1]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(None, None, -1)]```.\n\nWhile the ```:```-based notation is very helpful for simple slicing, the explicit use of ```slice()``` objects simplifies the programmatic generation of slicing.",

It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness. That's a tough one to come up with since such traits are usually the most powerful ones for surviving something.\n\nSo here's the environment and scenario I'm thinking of. Your smart guy race is in the stone age, its pretty much on par with homo sapiens and where they were at about 10,000-15,000 years ago. But something catastrophic doesn't happen. The world slowly becomes a perfect Eden with very few predators, a perfect climate, and vast endless fields of grain and forests of fruit bearing trees. No ice age, no super-predators like we saw in said ice age. No famines or depredation, no rabid competition between several human subspecies for the same resources. The planet (Henceforth known as paradise) is literally perfect. Too perfect.

Shelter is utterly not necessary since you have a perfect climate, nor is clothing, and food is so ludicrously plentiful there is no need to make tools.

Retirement (401k, IRA, SIMPLE, etc)\n2. Non-Retirement (Brokerage account, investing in individual stocks, day trading, etc)\n\nFor most individuals, it is best to take care of #1 first. Most people shouldn't even think about #2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts, established an emergency fund, and gotten their debt under control.\n\nThere are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing, both from your employer, and the government. All the more reason to take care of #1 before #2!\n\nYour employer probably offers some kind of 401k (or equivalent, like a 403b) with a company-provided match. This is a potential 100% return on your investment after the vesting period. No investment you make on your own will ever match that. Additionally, there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k. (The money you contribute doesn't count as taxable income.)\n\n***The best way to start investing is to learn about your employer's retirement plan, and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching.***\n\nBeyond this, there are also Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you can open to contribute money to on your own. You should open one of these and start contributing, but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k. The IRA won't give you that 100% ROI that the 401k will.\n\nKeep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much \"walled off\" from your day-to-day financial life. Money that goes into a retirement account generally can't be touched until retirement age, unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties. You generally don't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account.\n\nOne other thing to note: Your 401K and your IRA is an account that you put money into.

    "input": "",
    "output": "Quantum gate teleportation is the act of being able to apply a quantum gate on the unknown state while it is being teleported. This is one of the ways in which measurement-based computation can be described using graph states.\n\nUsually, teleportation works by having an unknown quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ held by Alice, and two qubits in the Bell state $|\\Psi\\rangle=(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ shared between Alice and Bob. Alice performs a Bell state measurement, getting one of 4 possible answers and Bob holds on his qubit, depending on the measurement result of Alice, one of the 4 states $|\\psi\\rangle,X|\\psi\\rangle,Z|\\psi\\rangle,ZX|\\psi\\rangle.$ So, once Bob learns what result Alice got, he can compensate by applying the appropriate Paulis.\n\nLet $U$ be a 1-qubit unitary. Assume Alice and Bob share $(\\mathbb{I}\\otimes U)|\\Psi\\rangle$ instead of $|\\Psi\\rangle$. If they repeat the teleportation protocol, Bob now has one of $U|\\psi\\rangle,UX|\\psi\\rangle,UZ|\\psi\\rangle,UZX|\\psi\\rangle$, which we can rewrite as $U|\\psi\\rangle,(UXU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle,(UZU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle,(UZXU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle.$ The compensations that Bob has to make for a given measurement result are given by the bracketed terms. Often, these are no worse than the compensations you would have to make for normal teleportation (i.e. just the Pauli rotations). For example, if $U$ is the Hadamard rotation, then the corrections are just $(\\mathbb{I},Z,X,XZ)$ respectively. So, you can apply the Hadamard during teleportation just be changing the state that you teleport through (There is a strong connection here to the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism). You can do the same for Pauli gates, and the phase gate $\\sqrt{Z}=S$. Moreover, if you repeat this protocol to build up a more complicated computation, it is often sufficient to keep a record of what these corrections are, and to apply them later.\n\nEven if you don't only need the Pauli gates (as is the case for $T=\\sqrt{S}$), the compensations may be easier than implementing the gate directly. This is the basis of the construction of the fault-tolerant T gate.\n\nIn fact, you can do something similar to apply a controlled-NOT between a pair of qubits as well. This time, the state you need is $|\\Psi\\rangle_{A_1B_1}|\\Psi\\rangle_{A_1B_1}$, and a controlled-NOT applied between $B_1$ and $B_2$. This time, there are 16 possible compensating rotations, but all of them are just about how Pauli operations propagate through the action of a controlled-NOT and, again, that just gives Pauli operations out.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Extracted from the reference How to Iterate Over a Map in Java:\nThere are several ways of iterating over a ```Map``` in Java. Let's go over the most common methods and review their advantages and disadvantages. Since all maps in Java implement the Map interface, the following techniques will work for any map implementation (```HashMap```, ```TreeMap```, ```LinkedHashMap```, ```Hashtable```, etc.)\n\nMethod #1: Iterating over entries using a For-Each loop.\nThis is the most common method and is preferable in most cases. It should be used if you need both map keys and values in the loop.\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nfor (Map.Entry entry : map.entrySet()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + entry.getKey() + \", Value = \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n```\nNote that the For-Each loop was introduced in Java 5, so this method is working only in newer versions of the language. Also a For-Each loop will throw ```NullPointerException``` if you try to iterate over a map that is null, so before iterating you should always check for null references.\n\nMethod #2: Iterating over keys or values using a For-Each loop.\nIf you need only keys or values from the map, you can iterate over keySet or values instead of entrySet.\n```Map map = new HashMap();\n// Iterating over keys only\nfor (Integer key : map.keySet()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key);\n}\n// Iterating over values only\nfor (Integer value : map.values()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nThis method gives a slight performance advantage over ```entrySet``` iteration (about 10% faster) and is more clean.\n\nMethod #3: Iterating using Iterator.\nUsing Generics:\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nIterator> entries = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (entries.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry entry = entries.next();\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + entry.getKey() + \", Value = \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n```\nWithout Generics:\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nIterator entries = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (entries.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) entries.next();\n    Integer key = (Integer)entry.getKey();\n    Integer value = (Integer)entry.getValue();\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key + \", Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nYou can also use same technique to iterate over ```keySet``` or values.\nThis method might look redundant, but it has its own advantages. First of all, it is the only way to iterate over a map in older versions of Java. The other important feature is that it is the only method that allows you to remove entries from the map during iteration by calling ```iterator.remove()```. If you try to do this during For-Each iteration you will get \"unpredictable results\" according to Javadoc.\nFrom a performance point of view this method is equal to a For-Each iteration.\n\nMethod #4: Iterating over keys and searching for values (inefficient).\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nfor (Integer key : map.keySet()) {\n    Integer value = map.get(key);\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key + \", Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nThis might look like a cleaner alternative for method #1, but in practice it is pretty slow and inefficient as getting values by a key might be time-consuming (this method in different Map implementations is 20%-200% slower than method #1). If you have FindBugs installed, it will detect this and warn you about inefficient iteration. This method should be avoided.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you need only keys or values from the map, use method #2. If you are stuck with older version of Java (less than 5) or planning to remove entries during iteration, you have to use method #3. Otherwise use method #1.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Decision diagrams (DDs) are most effective when they can compactly represent a large (perhaps exponential) set of solutions. This is done by merging equivalent states in each layer. To make decision diagrams scalable, we can use relaxed decision diagrams which allow merging nodes that are not necessarily equivalent. Relaxed decision diagrams provide dual bounds on the objective function -- a larger width can produce a stronger bound.\nThe relationship between the size of the decision diagram and the underlying combinatorial structure of the problem is well studied in the computer science literature; see for example the textbook by Wegener. The most important feature that influences the size is the variable ordering. We can use this to come up with some general guidelines on when a DD may be successful for combinatorial optimization:\n\n* The problem has a sequential structure, and decisions for stage $i$ depend only on the decisions made in stages $i-k$ through $i-1$, for small $k$.\n* The induced width of the constraint graph of the problem is small.\n* For a MIP model, the constraint matrix has a small bandwidth.\n* For knapsack-like problems, the maximum `budget' is relatively small.\n\nNote that in some of the above cases, precise characterization of 'small' may yield (pseudo-)polynomial bounds on the size of the exact DD. In practice, relaxed DDs will always have polynomial size.\nThere are several areas of combinatorial optimization in which decision diagrams have been successfully applied:\n\n* Sequencing and routing problems. For example, single machine scheduling with setup times, time windows, and/or precedence constraints, which can also be applied to constrained traveling salesperson problems. A similar decision diagram representation was used by Grubhub to solve pickup-and-delivery problems.\n* Decomposition and embedding in MIP models. Decision diagrams have been used to represent subproblems in MIP models that are otherwise difficult to linearize. For example, to represent nonlinear objective functions, constrained employee schedules, or nonlinear circuit design. DDs have also been used in column generation.\n* Graph-theoretic problems. Examples include set covering, maximum independent set, and maximum cut.\n* Constraint programming. Constraint propagation based on (relaxed) decision diagrams can be much more effective than propagating domains of individual variables. This was first demonstrated on overlapping alldifferent constraints.",

The network then decides which location to route a user request to, based on routing protocol costs and possibly the 'health' of the advertising servers.\n\nThere are several benefits to anycast. First, in steady state, users of an anycast service (DNS is an excellent example) will always connect to the 'closest' (from a routing protocol perspective) DNS server. This reduces latency, as well as providing a level of load-balancing (assuming that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network).\nAnother advantage is ease of configuration management. Rather than having to configure different DNS servers depending on where a server/workstation is deployed (Asia, America, Europe), you have one IP address that is configured in every location.\n\nDepending on how anycast is implemented, it can also provide a level of high availability. If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration.\n\nA final advantage is that of horizontal scaling; if you find that one server is being overly loaded, simply deploy another one in a location that would allow it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests. Again, as no client configuration is required, this can be done very quickly.",

As an example, let's take $\\mathbb{Z}$, which consists of all the integers. Is $\\mathbb Z$ countable?\n\nIt may seem uncountable if you pick a naive correspondence, say $1 \\mapsto 1$, $2 \\mapsto 2 ...$, which leaves all of the negative numbers unmapped. But if we organize the integers like this:\n$$0$$\n$$1, -1$$\n$$2, -2$$\n$$3, -3$$\n$$...$$\n\nWe quickly see that there is a map that works. Map 1 to 0, 2 to 1, 3 to -1, 4 to 2, 5 to -2, etc. So given an element $x$ in $\\mathbb Z$, we either have that $1 \\mapsto x$ if $x=0$, $2x \\mapsto x$ if $x > 0$, or $2|x|+1 \\mapsto x$ if $x . So the integers are countable.\n\nWe proved this by finding a map between the integers and the natural numbers. So to show that the union of countably many sets is countable, we need to find a similar mapping. First, let's unpack \"the union of countably many countable sets is countable\":\n1. \"countable sets\" pretty simple. If $S$ is in our set of sets, there's a 1-1 correspondence between elements of $S$ and $\\mathbb N$.\n2. \"countably many countable sets\" we have a 1-1 correspondence between $\\mathbb N$ and the sets themselves. In other words, we can write the sets as $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$... Let's call the set of sets $\\{S_n\\}, n \\in \\mathbb N$.\n3. \"union of countably many countable sets is countable\". There is a 1-1 mapping between the elements in $\\mathbb N$ and the elements in $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ...$\n\nSo how do we prove this? We need to find a correspondence, of course. Fortunately, there's a simple way to do this. Let $s_{nm}$ be the $mth$ element of $S_n$. We can do this because $S_n$ is by definition of the problem countable. We can write the elements of ALL the sets like this:\n$$s_{11}, s_{12}, s_{13} ...$$\n$$s_{21}, s_{22}, s_{23} ...$$\n$$s_{31}, s_{32}, s_{33} ...$$\n$$...$$\nNow let $1 \\mapsto s_{11}$, $2 \\mapsto s_{12}$, $3 \\mapsto s_{21}$, $4 \\mapsto s_{13}$, etc. You might notice that if we cross out every element that we've mapped, we're crossing them out in diagonal lines. With $1$ we cross out the first diagonal, $2-3$ we cross out the second diagonal, $4-6$ the third diagonal, $7-10$ the fourth diagonal, etc. The $nth$ diagonal requires us to map $n$ elements to cross it out. Since we never \"run out\" of elements in $\\mathbb N$, eventually given any diagonal we'll create a map to every element in it. Since obviously every element in $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ...$ is in one of the diagonals, we've created a 1-1 map between $\\mathbb N$ and the set of sets.\n\nLet's extend this one step further. What if we made $s_{11} = 1/1$, $s_{12} = 1/2$, $s_{21} = 2/1$, etc? Then $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ... = \\mathbb Q^+$! This is how you prove that the rationals are countable.

Sim, ele pode causar muito mal, assim como qualquer padrão de projeto aplicado indevidamente sem análise do impacto e dos efeitos colaterais.\n\n###Porque não usar\n* Acoplamento. Ao usar um Singleton você está acoplando o código a uma implementação estática e específica. Isso torna o seu código dependente dessa classe e impede, por exemplo, criar mocks em testes unitários. Desse ponto de vista a consequência é basicamente a mesma de fazer diretamente um ```new MeuObjetoImportante()```, pois é uma dependência direta da classe.\n* Escopo. O padrão Singleton aplicado conforme a definição também elimina o conceito de escopo. Isso significa que se você por alguma razão decidir que para determinados componentes da aplicação você precisa de outra implementação terá que alterar manualmente todas as classes.\n* Não garantia de uma instância única. Em certos casos o padrão pode levar à falsa segurança de que existirá apenas uma instância. Vamos supor que você projete um sistema web e quer dar acesso a um arquivo ou recurso exclusivo. Um Singleton parece uma boa prática, não é? Mas e se amanhã você fizer o deploy da aplicação em um cluster com N servidores.\n\nNo caso de Java isso também é bem complicado, pois não existe isso de uma classe por JVM. O conceito correto é uma classe por ```ClassLoader```, de forma que num mesmo servidor JEE duas aplicações diferentes podem ter, cada uma, sua própria versão de uma mesma classe. As variáveis estáticas não são compartilhadas entre essas versões da mesma classe, portanto o escopo do Singleton em Java é por ```ClassLoader``` e não por programa.\n\n###Porque usar\nEm algumas situações você sabe que vai ter só uma instância da classe. Em uma aplicação Desktop, por exemplo, não há porque ter \"frescuras\" adicionais para obter uma conexão com o banco de dados. \nTambém não vejo problemas em um objeto encapsulando alguns atributos de configuração globais. Simplesmente não valeria o esforço de implementar algum mecanismo muito elaborado para algo tão simples.\n\n###Como usar\nQuando pensamos em Singleton, logo a implementação clássica do Gang of Four nos vêm à mente. Os tópicos anteriores desta resposta consideraram isso. Porém, com a ascensão do uso de frameworks de Inversão de Controle (IoC) e Injeção de Dependência (DI), existe hoje uma forma muito mais \"segura\" e flexível de implementar o padrão: deixe o framework cuidar disso para você!\n\n###Como evitar o Singleton\nApesar de implementações mais simples poderem usar o padrão Singleton da forma \"clássica\" sem problemas, em geral seria melhor aplicar a Inversão de Controle simplesmente deixar a instância de suas dependências serem injetadas. Dessa forma, caso amanhã os requisitos mudem e você preciso injetar diferentes instâncias, ou mesmo queira criar mocks de teste, basta configurar seu container ou framework para tal, sem alterar as implementações existentes.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Sure, here are different preparations of eggs:\n\n1. Fried Eggs:\n* Sunny Side Up -- Not flipped, unbroken yolk. The top of the egg is just barely set.\n* Basted -- Sunny Side Up, hot fat spooned over until the white surrounding the yolk is opaque.\n* Over Easy / lite -- Flipped,  whites  fully cooked, unbroken yolk, yolk runny.\n* Over medium -- flipped, whites fully cooked, unbroken yolk, yolk creamy (not completely runny).\n* Over Medium Well -- Flipped, unbroken yolk, yolk cooked to have a firm but wet-appearing center.\n* Over Hard -- Flipped, broken, fully-cooked yolk.\n* Over Well -- Flipped, intact, fully-cooked yolk.\n* Broken / Lightly Scrambled -- Broken in pan and gently stirred while cooking - yolk and whites should not be mixed entirely.\n* Scrambled Eggs -- Made in many different ways. Generally the eggs are mixed in a bowl before being put into the pan, and often stirred while cooking. Some recipes add fat to the eggs in the form of milk, * cream, butter, or oil. A distinction can be made between Wet/Loose or Dry, which refers to the degree of doneness.\n\n2. Omelettes:\n* Filled Omelette -- Eggs mixed before cooking, possibly with added fat as in Scrambled Eggs. Cooked in fat in a saute pan; when set but the interior still wet, previously-cooked fillings (cheese, onions, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes...) are added, and the eggs folded over into a half-moon shape.\n* Spanish Omelette / Western Omelette -- Same as filled, but the egg mixture is poured over the fillings in a hot pan and cooked, thus incorporating the fillings into the egg.\n* Fluffy Omelette -- Whites and yolks beaten separately. Yolks are gently folded into the whites without breaking the structure of the whites. Optional toppings are added. Cooked slowly in a pan, or baked (an electric frying pan with a lid works well for this preparation).\n* French Omelette -- Cooked soft & creamy with no color on the egg. Omelette is folded 1/3 in the pan, knocked to the edge so it can be rolled out onto the plate. It ends up being folded into thirds and is very creamy and soft.\n\n3. Boiled:\nCooked in shell in water for a timed period. Some people will refer to degree of doneness by cooking time, i.e., a &quot;3-minute egg&quot; is soft-boiled with some runny white around the yolk. Some recipes call for eggs to be added to boiling water, others to be started in cold water. In the cold-water start, the pot may be left on the heat or removed when the water reaches a boil. The eggs may be shocked in ice water when removed.\n* Soft -- Yolk runny, potentially with slight unset white around the yolk.\n* Medium -- White completely set, yolk firm but with a dark, wet appearance.\n* Hard -- Yolk completely set and pale yellow.\n\n4. Poached:\nEgg cooked, out of shell, in water, stock, or other liquid --  excluding fats or oils -- at a temperature in the range of 160-180˚F (70-82˚C). There are possible degrees of doneness, however the typical poached egg has a runny but warm and thickened yolk and fully-set white.\n\n5. Coddled:\nAn egg that has been very lightly cooked (poached eggs are sometimes considered coddled). This can either be accomplished with an egg coddler or cooking an egg in its shell with water that is slightly below boiling point.\n\n6. Shirred:\nAn egg cooked in an oven at the low-mid 300's˚F (~160˚C), contained in a ramekin, until the whites are just set and the yolk is runny but thickened. Often butter or another fat is placed on top before cooking.\n\n7. Steamed:\nVery similar to shirred eggs, but the ramekin is covered with some aluminum foil and put in a steamer for 7-15 minutes.\n\n8. In a basket:\nEggs fried in a hole made in a slice of bread.\n\n9. deep fried\nMoo shu- using a strainer to drop small drops of egg into hot oil in a wok and stir. Frying in vegetables and/optionally meat or another protein then consume on mandarin pancakes with your choice of sauce.",

(It could go up to five with Action Surge, though.)\n\nThe Two-Weapon Fighting rule states (PHB, page 195):\n\n>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\n\nThe bonus action used as part of Two-Weapon Fighting is an attack, but it is not the Attack action.\nWhen you are a 5th-level fighter and you take the Attack action, you can make two attacks. You can also use your bonus action to make an additional attack. Notably, you can only take one bonus action per turn, since the rules for bonus actions state:\n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\n\nYou only add your ability modifier to the damage of that bonus-action attack if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style (PHB, page 72):\n\nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability\nmodifier to the damage of the second attack.\n\nTherefore, you are taking the Attack action (2 attacks) and then making an additional attack with your bonus action (1 attack), for a total of 3 attacks if you're using your action plus your bonus action. There's a clear difference between them.\nAction Surge lets a 5th-level fighter attack up to 5 times in one turn, once per short rest.\n\nThe description of the Action Surge feature says (PHB, page 72):\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.\n\nWhich means that if you use Action Surge, you would have 2 actions and 1 bonus action on your turn.\nSo with this, you can take your Attack action (2 attacks), then use Action Surge and take another Attack action (2 more attacks), and finally your Two-Weapon Fighting bonus action (one more attack), for a total of 5 attacks during your turn.",

Let us assume that it is centered, i.e. column means have been subtracted and are now equal to zero.\n\nThen the $p \\times p$ covariance matrix $\\mathbf C$ is given by $\\mathbf C = \\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X/(n-1)$. It is a symmetric matrix and so it can be diagonalized: $$\\mathbf C = \\mathbf V \\mathbf L \\mathbf V^\\top,$$ where $\\mathbf V$ is a matrix of eigenvectors (each column is an eigenvector) and $\\mathbf L$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ in the decreasing order on the diagonal. The eigenvectors are called principal axes or principal directions of the data. Projections of the data on the principal axes  are called principal components, also known as PC scores; these can be seen as new, transformed, variables. The $j$-th principal component is given by $j$-th column of $\\mathbf {XV}$. The coordinates of the $i$-th data point in the new PC space are given by the $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{XV}$.\n\nIf we now perform singular value decomposition of $\\mathbf X$, we obtain a decomposition $$\\mathbf X = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top,$$ where $\\mathbf U$ is a unitary matrix (with columns called left singular vectors), $\\mathbf S$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values $s_i$ and $\\mathbf V$ columns are called right singular vectors. From here one can easily see that $$\\mathbf C = \\mathbf V \\mathbf S \\mathbf U^\\top \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top /(n-1) = \\mathbf V \\frac{\\mathbf S^2}{n-1}\\mathbf V^\\top,$$ meaning that right singular vectors $\\mathbf V$ are principal directions (eigenvectors) and that singular values are related to the eigenvalues of covariance matrix via $\\lambda_i = s_i^2/(n-1)$. Principal components are given by $\\mathbf X \\mathbf V = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top \\mathbf V = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S$.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. If $\\mathbf X = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top$, then the columns of $\\mathbf V$ are principal directions/axes (eigenvectors).\n2. Columns of $\\mathbf {US}$ are principal components (&quot;scores&quot;).\n3. Singular values are related to the eigenvalues of covariance matrix via $\\lambda_i = s_i^2/(n-1)$. Eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ show variances of the respective PCs.\n4. Standardized scores are given by columns of $\\sqrt{n-1}\\mathbf U$ and loadings are given by columns of $\\mathbf V \\mathbf S/\\sqrt{n-1}$. See e.g. here and here for why &quot;loadings&quot; should not be confused with principal directions.\n5. The above is correct only if $\\mathbf X$ is centered. Only then is covariance matrix equal to $\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X/(n-1)$.\n6. The above is correct only for $\\mathbf X$ having samples in rows and variables in columns.

In Buddhist countries they may be venerated as Queen Maya, mother of the Buddha, was said to have been visited in a dream by a white elephant holding a white lotus flower, and Siddharth Gautama entered his mother's womb in the form a white elephant. The white elephant is also associated with traits like mental strength and purity.\nIt became a royal symbol in Siam (Thailand); the king continues to keep  white elephants. The story emerged that if a courtier displeased him, the king would make him a gift of a white elephant. The courtier could hardly decline a royal gift, and could hardly afford not to maintain a sacred animal, and could not put it to productive use, and so would be ruined by the cost of upkeep.\nThe earliest example of its use is from a 1721 essay in London Journal:\n\n  In short, Honour and Victory are generally no more than white Elephants; and for white Elephants the most destructive Wars have been often made.\n\nA 2011 paper by Ross Bullen entitled “This Alarming Generosity”: White Elephants and the Logic of the Gift, in American Literature, covers the popularization of the term in the mid-19th century, presents an alternative account, that the story is a piece of orientalism and the white elephant rose as a literary trope.",

It does not attempt to make flag burning illegal in general (i.e. outside of those specific circumstances). Clinton has voted against a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would allow Congress to ban flag burning in general.\n\nIn 2005, Clinton co-sponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005, whose summary is as follows:\n\n> Flag Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag.\n\nIt seems like a reaction to ongoing efforts to pass a constitutional amendment allowing Congress to ban flag burning, a move that the co-sponsors of the 2005 act oppose and voted against. Its text notes:\n\n> the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by free and democratic nations\n\nbut suggests that flag burning with intent to incite violence is not protected by the Constitution (unlike flag burning as political expression, which is protected):\n\n> destruction of the flag of the United States can be intended to incite a violent response rather than make a political statement and such conduct is outside the protections afforded by the first amendment to the Constitution.\n\nNote that the distinction between \n\n* banning flag burning for being offensive, and \n* banning flag burning when it incites violence or disturbs the peace\n\nis an important one. The Flag Protection Act proposed in 2005 was essentially a replacement for a previous Flag Protection Act that banned flag burning in general:\n\n> Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\nbut this was deemed unconstitutional in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 in 1990, on the basis of their earlier (1989) decision in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397. There, the Supreme Court noted that\n\n> an important governmental interest in regulating nonspeech can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms when speech and nonspeech elements are combined in the same course of conduct\n\nbut that in the case under consideration, this did not apply:\n\n> An interest in preventing breaches of the peace is not implicated on this record. \n\nand further noted that \n\n> Expression may not be prohibited [p398] on the basis that an audience that takes serious offense to the expression may disturb the peace, since the Government cannot assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but must look to the actual circumstances surrounding the expression.\n\nClinton was not one of the 59 co-sponsors of a proposed amendment to the constitution that would allow Congress to ban flag burning in general:\n\n> Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\nand she also voted against it.

But there's no be-all-end-all question asking:\nWhat exactly determines depth of field in a photograph? \nIs it just a property of the lens?

    "output": "I'm going to dispense with the formulas, photos of rulers and definitions of \"magnification\" and go with what you actually experience in practice. The major factors that actually matter to shooting are:\n\n* Aperture. Wide aperture lenses give you a shallower depth of field. This is probably the least controversial factor! This is important as some lenses have much larger apertures e.g. 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 vs. 50 f/1.8 \n* Subject distance. This is a really important consideration. Depth of field gets drastically shallower when you start to get really close. This is important as at macro focussing distances DoF is a major problem. It also means you can get shallow DoF regardless of aperture if you get close enough, and that if you want deep DoF in low light compose to focus further away.\n* Focal length. This does affect depth of field, but only in certain ranges, when maintaining subject size. Wide lenses have very deep depth of field at most subject distances. Once you get past a certain point, DoF changes very little with focal length. This is important again because if you want to increase / decrease DoF you can use focal length to do this whilst still filling the frame with your subject.\n* Sensor size. This affects DoF when you maintain the same subject distance and field of view between sensor sizes. The bigger the sensor the shallower the depth of field. DSLRs have much bigger sensors than compacts, and so for the same FoV and f-ratio they have shallower DoF. This is important because by the same token cropping images increases DoF when maintaining the same final output size, as it's akin to using a smaller sensor.\n",

The sprite is eight pixels wide, and each pixel is two bits, which is why it's two memory accesses per sprite per scanline. You can imagine that this arrangement just needs a couple of shift registers to clock the pixels out.\n\nNow, flipping the sprite about its vertical axis is easy: you just clock the pixels out in reverse order! Similarly, flipping the sprite about its horizontal axis is also easy: You just fetch the bitmap from memory in reverse order. Rotating by 180° of course is the same as flipping both horizontally and vertically.\n\nBut if you wanted to rotate the sprite 90° or 270°, that's much harder. That's because the hardware would need to get one pixel from each pair of bytes, which means fetching 16 bytes from memory instead of just two. There is not enough time on this slow hardware to do that. Incidentally, this is also where the maximum number of sprites per scanline limitation comes from.\n\nIt's a similar story on the Commodore 64, the Atari 2600, and many others: These platforms can do some simple 2D manipulations on sprites like stretching and sometimes flipping like you've seen, but never rotations.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "The frequency resolution is dependent on the relationship between the FFT length and the sampling rate of the input signal.\n\nIf we collect 8192 samples for the FFT then we will have:\n$$\\frac{8192\\ \\text{samples}}{2} = 4096\\ \\,\\text{FFT bins}$$\n\nIf our sampling rate is 10 kHz, then the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem says that our signal can contain frequency content up to 5 kHz. Then, our frequency bin resolution is:\n$$\\frac{5\\ \\text{kHz}}{4096\\ \\,\\text{FFT bins}} \\simeq \\frac{1.22\\ \\text{Hz}}{\\text{bin}}$$\n\nThis is may be the easier way to explain it conceptually but simplified: &nbsp;your bin resolution is just \\$\\frac{f_{samp}}{N}\\$, where \\$f_{samp}\\$ is the input signal's sampling rate and N is the number of FFT points used (sample length).\n\nWe can see from the above that to get smaller FFT bins we can either run a longer FFT (that is, take more samples at the same rate before running the FFT) or decrease our sampling rate.\n\n## The Catch:\nThere is always a trade-off between temporal resolution and frequency resolution.\n\nIn the example above, we need to collect 8192 samples before we can run the FFT, which when sampling at 10 kHz takes 0.82 seconds. \n\nIf we tried to get smaller FFT bins by running a longer FFT it would take even longer to collect the needed samples.\nThat may be OK, it may not be.  The important point is that at a fixed sampling rate, increasing frequency resolution decreases temporal resolution. That is the more accurate your measurement in the frequency domain, the less accurate you can be in the time domain. You effectively lose all time information inside the FFT length.\n\nIn this example, if a 1999 Hz tone starts and stops in the first half of the 8192 sample FFT and a 2002 Hz tone plays in the second half of the window, we would see both, but they would appear to have occurred at the same time.\n\nYou also have to consider processing time.  A 8192 point FFT takes some decent processing power.  A way to reduce this need is to reduce the sampling rate, which is the second way to increase frequency resolution.\n\nIn your example, if you drop your sampling rate to something like 4096 Hz, then you only need a 4096 point FFT to achieve 1 Hz bins *4096 Hz, then you only need a 4096 point FFT to achieve 1hz bins and can still resolve a 2khz signal.  This reduces the FFT bin size, but also reduces the bandwidth of the signal.\n\nUltimately with an FFT there will always be a trade off between frequency resolution and time resolution.  You have to perform a bit of a balancing act to reach all goals.",

This is the energy that is actually transferred.\n\nNow to compare the two measurements:\nIf voltage and current are both sinewaves, then $\\text{watts} = \\text{volt-amps} \\times \\cos(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the phase angle between voltage and current. It's pretty easy to see from this that if they're both sine waves and if they're in phase ($\\phi = 0$), then $\\text{watts} = \\text{volt-amps}$.\n\nHowever, if you're NOT dealing with sine waves, the $\\cos(\\phi)$ relationship no longer applies! So you have to go the long way around and actually do the measurements as described here.\n\nHow might that happen? Easy. DC power supplies. They're everywhere, including battery chargers, and the vast majority of them only draw current at the peak of the AC voltage waveform because that's the only time that their filter capacitors are otherwise less than the input voltage. So they draw a big spike of current to recharge the caps, starting just before the voltage peak and ending right at the voltage peak, and then they draw nothing until the next peak.\n\nAnd of course there's an exception to this rule also, and that is Power Factor Correction (PFC). DC power supplies with PFC are specialized switching power supplies that end up producing more DC voltage than the highest AC peak, and they do it in such a way that their input current follows the input voltage almost exactly. Of course, this is only an approximation, but the goal is to get a close enough match that the $\\cos(\\phi)$ shortcut becomes acceptably close to accurate, with $\\phi \\approx 0$. Then, given this high voltage DC, a secondary switching supply produces what is actually required by the circuit being powered.",

    "instruction": "In this Creation magazine reprint of a 1994 article titled Exploding stars point to a young universe,  Young-Earth Creationist, Jonathan Sarfati argues that the scarcity of Supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky suggests the Milky Way galaxy is less than billions of years old.\n\nOn average, a galaxy like our own, the Milky Way, should produce one supernova every 25 years.\n[...]\nAs can be readily seen above, a young universe model fits the data of the low number of observed SNRs. If the universe was really billions of years old, there are 7000 missing SNRs in our galaxy.\n\nDoes astronomy predict a Milky Way supernova every 25 years? Are there missing SNRs that undermine these predictions?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "There are many reasons why this is wrong. The first one is the assumption of 1 supernova per 25 years. That was the value arrived at in Gustav Tammann's article published in 1970. Others got values up to 100 years (Tammann himself changed his value later). All these values are really only good guesses.\n\nWorse errors are made in the percentage of remnants that should be visible. To start with, only a small percentage of them are visible; the others are obscured by dust in the galaxy. This does not happen to the same extent to the supernovas themselves, as they are intrinsically very much brighter. \n\nSarfati also uses an old paper to come up with the number of remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way). However, that figure was considered to be wrong (and much smaller) in later studies. Older remnants are very difficult to distinguish against a background of dust in the galaxy. Many of them disappear completely after about 10,000 years or so.\n\nIt should be noted that, using Sarfati's own reasoning, we should not be able to see any remnants older than 6000 years. Instead, we know of remnants (e.g. G166.2 + 2.5) that are over 100,000 years old. How did those originate in his universe? The same goes for the distance to supernovas. The distance to SN 1987A has been trigonometrically measured at 167,000 light years (the paper says 51,200 parsecs). In other words, its light took more than 30 times longer to reach us than the creationist universe has supposedly existed. \n\nRemember also that a supernova typically becomes either a pulsar or a black hole, both of which are very hard to observe. A black hole can only be \"seen\" through its effects on other matter, and a pulsar is mainly visible if the solar system happens to be in line with its sweeping radio beam (with some pulsars the star itself has also been seen). Hence, all we can see of them long after the event is an expanding cloud of gas that gets dimmer over the millennia.\n\nThere are several other reasons which are covered in a very good article on TalkOrigins. That article has links to all the original scientific papers referred to, so you can check the validity yourself.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "There are multiple purposes behind the novel structure of Moby-Dick.\n\nIn the first instance the author was himself a whaleman, having spent 18 months as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler Acushnet in 1841–42. In his experience the literature of the day, such as Miriam \n\nCoffin or The Whale-Fisherman by Joseph Hart, did not portray whaling accurately but rather sensationalised it. He wished to provide his readers with a more realistic account.\n\nIn doing so, he also gave the reader the information necessary to better understand and appreciate the passages of whaling described in the novel. With the reader forewarned, he is able to keep the narrative passages tense and exciting. It is interesting that, early in the novel, the Pequod meets virutally no whales and that the chases become longer and more involved as the story progresses. This may be because Melville felt he needed to give the reader more and more technical information before they could fully appreicate these encounters, but understood the science would need to be spaced out among the narrative.\n\nIn describing it to the reader, the science also serves another useful narrative function. It indicates that on whaling voyages, long periods of time pass when nothing much happens at all. By padding out of the story with scientific digressions serves as a useful narrative metaphor for waiting.\n\nThe level of detail provided also mirrors one of the novel's central themes: obsession. Although Ishmael is the narrator and Ahab the obvious obsessive, the amount of science indicates that Ishmael is also an obsessive. His obsession is the business of whaling itself.\n\nFinally, Melville made good use of these passages in serving as metaphors for other themes of the novel where he felt it appropriate. For example in the chapter The Line, which describes how the whale line is stored and used in the boat, it ends by using the line as a metaphor.\n\n  \"All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\"\n",

This eliminates one of the major advantages of space until you get above several meters mirror diameter.\n(2) Rocket fairings are the shrouds which protect payloads during the supersonic atmospherics speeds reached during launch. A 5 meter fairing is about the largest that can be flown, which limits the size of the one-piece mirrors which can be launched.  (The Dreaded Webb Telescope's mirror is in pieces which will assemble themselves in space -- a very scary and very expensive piece of design.)\n(3) Servicing a telescope on the top of Mauna Kea or in the high Chilean Andes is a difficult and expensive process. Servicing a telescope in orbit makes that look like small change.  (Cost comparable to the cost of building a new giant scope on Earth.) And in-orbit servicing can't even be done with current technology except in low earth orbit.\n(4) While high resolution is one frontier in astronomy, going deep is another, and going deep requires big mirrors.  A 30 meter mirror on Earth gathers much more light than a 5 meter mirror in space.  The giant terrestrial telescopes simply do a better job of being light buckets for spectroscopy than anything we can yet put into space.\n\nThe bottom line is that with the development of adaptive optics, space-based telescopes of currently buildable and launchable size lost their main advantage over ground-based telescopes.  And since they're 10x to 100x the cost, they are simply not worth building for many purposes.\n\nSpace based telescopes still hold a significant edge in parts of the spectrum blocked by the atmosphere such as UV and IR (Webb), and for certain tasks involving long-term high accuracy photometry (Kepler) and astrometry (Gaia).  But for general purpose use, the balance seems firmly on the ground's side for large telescopes.\n\nThis will change if space flight becomes cheaper -- the SpaceX BFR, for example, with its 9 meter fairing and dramatically lower launch costs, offers great hope for space telescopes.",

This means if you're in a room with a range of brightness greater than about 100 to 1 the brightest things will all be washed out as white and the darkest things will all be essentially black. This is obvious in photos that are \"backlit\" like this one:\n\nThese horses aren't black but because the ratio of the bright light to the dark horses exceeds the dynamic range of the camera the sky is washed out white and the horses are in silhouette.\nYour eye can adjust over time to a huge range but it can't utilize the whole range all at once.\nIn the case of dust reflecting light, if you allow a lot of light into the room the relative brightness between the small amount of light the dust is reflecting and the rest of the illuminated room prevent you from seeing the dust.\n\nThis is fundamental to signal processing. Why can't you hear a whisper in a noisy room?  The noise of the crowd obscures the whisper. The difference between the signal you're trying to pick up and the background noise is called the signal-to-noise ratio.

    "output": "All numerical atmospheric models are built around calculations derived from primitive equations that describe atmospheric flow. Vilhelm Bjerknes discovered the relationships and thereby became the father of numerical weather prediction. Conceptually, the equations can be thought of as describing how a parcel of air would move in relationship to its surroundings. For instance, we learn at a young age that hot air rises. The hydrostatic vertical momentum equation explains why and quantifies under what condictions hot air would stop rising. (As the air rises it expands and cools until it reaches hydrostatic equilibrium.) The other equations consider other types of motion and heat transfer.\n\nUnfortunately, the equations are nonlinear, which means that you can't simply plug in a few numbers and get useful results. Instead, weather models are simulations which divide the atmosphere into three-dimensional grids and calculate how matter and energy will flow from one cube of space into another during discrete time increments. Actual atmospheric flow is continuous, not discrete, so by necessity the models are approximations. Different models make different approximations appropriate to their specific purpose.\n\nNumerical models have been improving over time for several reasons:\n\n* More and better input data,\n* Tighter grids, and\n* Better approximations.\n\nIncreasing computational power has allowed models to use smaller grid boxes. However, the number of computations increases exponentially with the number of boxes and the process suffers diminishing returns. On the input end of things, more and better sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model. Synoptic scale and mesoscale models take input from General Circulation Models, which helps set reasonable intial conditions. On the output end, Model Output Statistics do a remarkable job of estimating local weather by comparing the current model state with historical data of times when the model showed similar results. Finally, ensemble models take the output of several models as input and produce a range of possibly outcomes.",

    "instruction": "I am currently trying to decipher Mazur's Eisenstein ideal paper (not a comment about his clarity, rather about my current abilities). One of the reasons I am doing that is that many people told me that the paper was somehow revolutionary and introduced a new method into number theory. \nCould you explain exactly what subsequent developments did the paper bring, what ideas in the paper were considered more-or-less original (at the time it was published), and exactly what difficulties did these ideas resolve that people failed to resolve before the paper was published (if any)?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "First, Mazur's paper is arguably the first paper where the new ideas (and language) of the Grothendieck revolution in algebraic geometry were fully embraced and crucially used in pure number theory.  Here are several notable examples: Mazur makes crucial use of the theory of finite flat group schemes to understand the behavior of the $p$-adic Tate modules of Jacobians at the prime $p$. He studies modular forms of level one over finite rings (which need not lift to characteristic zero when the residue characteristic is $2$ or $3$). He proves theorems about mod-$p$ modular forms using what are essentially comparison theorems between etale cohomology and de Rham cohomology, and many more examples. The proof of the main theorem ($\\S5$, starting at page 156) is itself a very modern proof which fundamentally uses the viewpoint of $X_0(N)$ as a scheme.\n\nSecond, there are many beautiful ideas which have their original in this paper: it contains many of the first innovative ideas for studying $2$-dimensional (and beyond) Galois representations, including the link between geometric properties (multiplicity one) and arithmetic properties, geometric conceptions for studying congruences between Galois representations, understanding the importance of the finite-flat property of group schemes, and the identification of the Gorenstein property. There is a theoretical $p$-descent on the Eisenstein quotient when previously descents were almost all explicit $2$-descents with specific equations. It introduces the winding quotient, and so on.\n\nThird, while it is a dense paper, it is dense in the best possible way: many of the small diversions could have made interesting papers on their own. Indeed, even close readers of the paper today can find connections between Mazur's asides and cutting edge mathematics. When Mazur raises a question in the text, it is almost invariably very interesting. One particular (great) habit that Mazur has is thinking about various isomorphisms and by pinning down various canonical choices identifies refined invariants. To take a random example, consider his exploration of the Shimura subgroup at the end of section 11. He finishes with a question which to a casual reader may as well be a throw-away remark. But this question was first solved by Merel, and more recently generalized in some very nice work of Emmanuel Lecouturier. Lecouturier's ideas then played an important role in the work of Michael Harris and Akshay Venkatesh. Again, one could give many more such examples of this. Very few papers have the richness of footnotes and asides that this paper does. Never forget that one of the hardest things in mathematics is coming up with interesting questions and observations, and this paper contains many great ones - it is bursting with the ideas of a truly creative mathematician.\n\nFinally, the result itself is amazing, and (pretty much) remains the only method available for proving the main theorem (the second proof due to Mazur is very related to this one). To give a sense of how great the theorem is, note that if $E$ is a semistable elliptic curve, then either $E$ is isogenous to a curve with a $p$-torsion point, or $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible. This result (added for clarity: explicitly, Mazur's Theorem that $E/\\mathbf{Q}$ doesn't have a $p$-torsion point for $p > 7$) is crucially used in Wiles' proof of Fermat. One could certainly argue that without this paper (and how it transformed algebraic number theory) we would not have had Wiles' proof of Fermat, but it's even literally true that Mazur's theorem was (and remains so today, over 40 years later) an essential step in any proof of Fermat.",

In particular, it occurs at much lower temperatures and at a much lower rate. A cubic metre of material in the solar core is only releasing around 250 W of power by fusion.\nThe fusion rate is set by the temperature (and to a lesser extent, density) of the core. This in turn is set by the need for a pressure gradient to balance the weight of material pressing down on it from above. At 15 million kelvin (the core temperature, which is much lower than the temperatures in nuclear bombs or fusion reactors), the average proton has a lifetime of several billion years before being converted (with three others) into a helium nucleus. There are two reasons this is slow. First, you have to get protons, which repel each other electromagnetically, close enough together to feel the strong nuclear force. This is why high temperatures are needed. Second, because the diproton is unstable, one of the protons needs to change into a neutron via a weak force interaction, whilst it is in the unstable diproton state, to form a deuterium nucleus. This is just inherently unlikely and means the overall reaction chain to helium is very slow.\nThe reason there is no bomb-like explosion is because there is no problem in shifting 250 W per cubic metre away from the core, in the same way that a compost heap, which generates about the same power density, does not spontaneously explode. In the case of a star any additional heat goes into more radiation that diffuses away and in work done in expanding the star. As a result, the temperature of the core is stable.  Ultimately, any additional energy emerges as sunlight at the solar photosphere.\nIf for some reason, the opacity to radiation in the core increased, then the temperature would rise and more energy would be generated by fusion. This is exactly what happens in the core as more hydrogen is turned into helium; the core temperature and luminosity do rise, but slowly, on timescales of billions of years.",

Evaporation — As the initially warmer water cools to the initial temperature of the initially cooler water, it may lose significant amounts of water to evaporation.

    "output": "Reflection é um termo usado para indicar a capacidade de obter metadados sobre o próprio programa compilado, em português pode-se referir a isso como reflexão mesmo.\nComo assim, metadados?\nObter informações sobre os tipos de dados, de forma dinâmica, é muito importante para códigos que atuam sobre objetos que não se conhece em tempo de design. É muito usado em bibliotecas que se propõem a lidar com objetos de tipos que elas desconhecem em sua concepção.\nO ASP.NET MVC por exemplo, só é um projeto possível por causa da reflexão. De que forma ele poderia chamar os métodos dos controllers, que ele nem conhece?\nVisto, isso é preciso dizer que reflexão não é sempre rápido, é necessário verificar permissões, o nível de segurança em que o código está rodando, entre outras. Por isso, quando se obtém um resultado qualquer vindo através da reflexão, geralmente essas informações são colocadas em cache, ou seja, salvas em memória.\nÉ recomendável?\nDepende do uso:\n\n* sim, é recomendável: para criar comportamentos dinâmicos usando atributos, a única opção é reflexão\n* sim, é recomendável: para chamar método que não se conhece durante a concepção do sistema, também é a única opção\n* não, é abuso fazer isso: chamar um método, de uma classe conhecida em design-time usando reflexão... é absurdo\n\nExistem tantas formas de usar reflexão que eu poderia continuar essa lista por muito tempo. Então mais vale o seguinte conselho: bom senso.\nComo usar?\nExistem alguns vetores de uso de reflexão que eu conheço. Para demonstrá-los, vamos considerar primeiramente a seguinte classe:\n```public class Pessoa\n{\n    public string Nome { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n* Expressões Lambda: esse é um vetor de reflexão, pois é possível usar expressões lambda para chegar aos tipos, métodos entre outros objetos refletidos, que tenham sido usados na expressão. É comumente utilizado para tornar fortemente tipada a obtenção de objetos refletidos de membros de uma classe, antes disso só era possível obter esses objetos indicando uma string com o nome do método.\n```Expression> expr = p => p.Nome;\nvar lambda = (LambdaExpression)expr;\nvar cast = lambda.Body as UnaryExpression;\nvar member = (cast != null ? cast.Operand : lambda.Body) as MemberExpression;\nvar propInfo = member.Member as PropertyInfo;\nConsole.WriteLine(propInfo.Name); // \"Nome\"\n```\n* typeof(Tipo): essa é uma das formas mais comuns de obter informações refletidas do sistema. Serve para obter informações sobre o tipo indicado diretamente.\n```var tipo = typeof(Pessoa);\nConsole.WriteLine(tipo.Name); // \"Pessoa\"\n```\n* obj.GetType(): tão comum quando ```typeof```, mas ao invés de se referir a um tipo diretamente, refere-se ao tipo do objeto em questão: mas tem um detalhe, não é do tipo declarado da variável, mas sim do objeto em si.\n```var p = new Pessoa();\nvar tipo = p.GetType();\nConsole.WriteLine(tipo.IsSealed); // \"false\"\n```\n* Assembly: é usada para obter tipos em larga escala: por exemplo, para escanear todos os tipos existentes em um assembly, ou então em todos os assemblies carregados.\n```// localizando um tipo, dentre todos os tipos carregados\nvar todosOsTiposCarregados = AppDomain.CurrentDomain\n    .GetAssemblies()\n    .SelectMany(a => a.GetTypes())\n    .Where(t => t.Name == \"Pessoa\");\n```\n\nE o namespace Reflection.Emit?\nNão está claro na minha mente se considero isso reflexão ou não. Mas de qualquer forma, é necessário usar reflexão para gerar código dinamicamente, então tem uma conexão.\nComo disse, esse namespace contém classes usadas para gerar código dinamicamente... e então compilá-los. Lembra do que eu falei sobre cache de reflexão... compilar métodos é um bom alvo de cache, pois depois de compilado os futuros usos serão muitíssimo rápidos.",

As such, all the outlets in our kitchen are GFCI outlets.\nThis call with Nespresso was the first time I'd ever seen someone claim that GFCI outlets can potentially damage coffee machines.\nCan they damage Nespresso machines?

    "output": "\n> the Nespresso support agent said that the machines should not be connected to a GFCI outlet\n\nWhere do they think Nespresso machines are used? Bedrooms? No, they're kitchen appliances and GFCIs are widely used in kitchens. GFCIs are code requirements and have been for ~20 years. If they are unable to make a GFCI-compatible machine, then their machine is unfit for purpose, and they have breached their implied warranty. Also, the things use water, for Pete's sake.\n\nThat said, machines do break. On a modern &quot;mass produced, not expected to be repaired&quot; machine, that means it is &quot;at end-of-life&quot;.\n\n> This call with Nespresso was the first time I'd ever seen someone claim that GFCI outlets can potentially damage coffee machines.\n\nLOL no. Such a claim is both nonsensical and inexcusable, and is certainly not coming from their technical department, nor has it been reviewed by their legal team, nor will you ever get them to put that in writing.  Most likely it is because companies put tremendous pressure on customer service agents to have a high rate of good ratings, &quot;close it in 1 call&quot; and &quot;avoid shipping replacement units&quot;. A GFCI-trip call is a worst-case scenario for an agent, and so they're going to say whatever they need to to get a satisfactory 1-call close.  That is about their only option.\n\nIn a rare case, the GFCI might be end-of-life and not be working properly, but that is easily tested by plugging it into the next outlet over that is on a different GFCI, since kitchens generally have 2 independent circuits.\n\nNow, other things can damage a coffee maker. Notably a &quot;Lost Neutral&quot;, where the neutral lead from the power company breaks, causing neutral in the house to wander - the two 120V &quot;halves of the service&quot; still add up to 240V but they are lopsided, with one side higher than 120V. That is particularly hard on resistive heat appliances, since their heat increases by the square of voltage increase.  Lost neutrals can be pernicious and difficult to detect, so it can go weeks or months without being noticed. It's not like service panels have voltmeters on them.",

    "output": "You can do stretches, strengthening and breathing exercises to improve your posture. But you also have to become aware of your posture and find a way to interrupt prolonged sitting intervals with brief breaks.  A good ergonomic chair is also helpful.\n\n## Musculo-Skeletal Effects of Poor Sitting Posture\n\nPoor sitting posture can create muscle imbalances over time.\n\n* In general, your front stuctures shorten, with muscles like your hip flexors and pectorals tightening up - pulling you into a ball.  Your crunched sitting posture caves your lower ribs down towards your abdomen which prevents the diaphragm from expanding freely. \n* At the same time the muscles of your back stretch out and weaken, especially in the range where they should be working to maintain your posture.\n\nAs this posture persists over time, you joints begin to lose normal range of motion as well making it more difficult to assume a good posture.\n\n\n## Correcting Slumped Sitting Posture\nTailor an exercise program to stretch tightened muscles and strengthen weakened muscles.  Additionally, you need a method to become aware of your posture and correct it while you are sitting.  This is difficult because as you say, your attention is on your work. Exercise programs like Yoga, Tai-Chi and Pilates are good because they all address and make you very aware of your posture, joint alignments, flexibility, core control and breathing.\n\nUse Specific Exercises to Correct Muscle Imbalances:\n\n* Back, Upper Back and Scapular muscles:  Back Extensions strengthen your paraspinals.  Use different arm positions (Y, T, W, L) to target your lower traps, mid traps, rhomboids and scapular stabilizors.  Learn the feel of retracting your scapulas.\nYou can do these on the floor next to your desk. \nOr if you prefer not to get on the floor, use resistance bands for reverse flys, wide rows, narrow rows and rotations. \nAway from work, you can also strengthen these muscles using weights, cables and body weight exercises like inverted rows, cable rows, bent over rows, reverse flys etc.  And squats are a good for strengthening multiple muscles important to posture.\n* Core:  Plank, Side Plank, Bird Dog and Bridge will stabilize your trunk and spine.\n* Stretches: - Hip Flexors, Hamstrings, Abs and Pecs.  The wall pec stretch stretches the pecs but also contracts the rhomboid and trapezius scapular muscles to help improve the positioning of the shoulder and shoulder blade and is easy to do at work. \n* Sitting Posture and Breathing Awareness - This sitting posture exercise helps make you aware of your sitting alignment and expanding your diaphragm.  Practice a few diaphramatic breaths throughout the day along with this sitting exercise to elongate your spine.\n\nCreate your ideal short exercise routine that you can do during short breaks during the day. An exercise ball next to your desk can help you target these muscles in just a few minutes:\n\n* Lie back over the ball and stretch out your front \n* Lie face down over the ball and do the Y, W, T, L exercises.\nAnd consider using the ball as your desk chair for short periods.\n\n## Remembering your Posture throughout the day:\n\nThis is the hard part.  As your muscle imbalances begin to resolve and your diaphragmatic breathing improves, you’ll find that the slouched posture becomes less comfortable and you will automatically begin to sit better.  Until then, use a timed reminder or try tying your posture corrections to tasks that you do at the computer regularly.  For example, correct your posture each time you check your email or some other specific link.  Turn on your web cam for visual reminders.\n\nKeep at it until you feel the improvement.  You'll have less problems going forward if you improve your posture.  It either gets better - or it gets worse.",

Increasing your dodge chance (i.e. more power to engines) will help this occur quicker, but even with the default chance you can max out the skill eventually.\n\n###Engines\nExactly as for piloting, a crew member manning the engines gains one point of XP for each projectile evaded while uncloaked in combat - and so it can be trained in the same way.\n\n###Weapons\nA crew member who is manning the weapons station gains one point of experience for each weapon that is fired.  It doesn't matter whether it hits or misses, or whether it can do damage (e.g. a beam weapon fired at a shield).\n(Multi-shot weapons such as burst lasers still count as a single fire order and hence a single XP.)\nThis can be trained by firing non-lethal weapons (e.g. ones that do ion damage) repeatedly against a target that cannot damage you.\n\n###Shields\nA crew member manning the shields station gains one point of experience for each shield \"bubble\" that is brought back up during combat.  It doesn't matter why the shields were down, be that direct enemy fire, ion damage, asteroid strikes, or even manually removing and then restoring power to the shield systems.\nThis can be trained by letting a target that cannot break through all of your shields repeatedly take one layer down. (For fastest results, move your pilot away from the helm, or reduce your engines to 0 power.  This will reduce your dodge chance to 0%, ensuring that everything hits your shields.)\nNote that you used to be able to manually remove power and restore it in combat, to get points, but this has been patched.\n\n###Repair\nA crew member gains one point of experience for getting the \"finishing blow\" when repairing a (sub)system.  Note that hull breaches provide no repair experience.\nThere's no specific way to train this as it requires your systems to be damaged.  Though you can focus the XP gains by always having the same person run around and repair everything after a battle.\n\n###Combat\nA crew member gains one point of experience for getting the finishing blow when fighting an enemy crew member or (sub)system.\nThis generally gets trained in \"real\" situations.

That means that it runs a piece of Javascript until it returns control back to the interpreter.  Then, only when it returns back to the interpreter, Javascript gets the next event from the event queue and runs it.\nAll things like timers and network events run through the event queue.  So, when a timer fires or a network request arrives, it does not ever \"interrupt\" the currently running Javascript.  Instead, an event gets put in the Javascript event queue and then, when the currently running Javascript finishes, the next event is pulled from the event queue and it gets its turn to run.\nSo, when you do an infinite loop such as ```while(flag==false) {}```, the currently running Javascript never finishes and thus the next event is never pulled from the event queue and thus the value of ```flag``` never gets changed.  They key here is that Javascript is not interrupt driven.  When a timer fires, it does not interrupt the currently running Javascript, run some other Javascript and then let the currently running Javascript continue.  It just gets put in the event queue waiting until the currently running Javascript is done to get its turn to run.\n\nWhat you need to do is rethink how your code works and find a different way to trigger whatever code you want to run when the ```flag``` value changes.  Javascript is designed as an event-driven language.  So, what you need to do is figure out what events you can register an interest in so you can either listen for the event that might cause the flag to change and you can examine the flag on that event or you can trigger your own event from whatever code might change the flag or you can implement a callback function that whatever code changes that flag can call your callback whenever the piece of code responsible for changing the flag value would change it's value to ```true```, it just calls the callback function and thus your code that wants to run when the flag gets set to ```true``` will get to run at the right time.  This is much, much more efficient than trying to use some sort of timer to constantly check the flag value.\n```function codeThatMightChangeFlag(callback) {\n    // do a bunch of stuff\n    if (condition happens to change flag value) {\n        // call the callback to notify other code\n        callback();\n    }\n}\n```",

The effective gene length in a sample is then the average of the transcript lengths after weighting for their relative expression (yes, one should remove $\\mu$ in there).

Who steered the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 through the British Parliament. This legislated for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar for Britain and its then colonies. \n\nThere were some missing days (internet archive link) in the British calendar in 1752 when the adjustment was finally made from the Julian calendar. September 3, 1752 to September 13, 1752 were lost.\nKalen Delaney explained the choice this way\n\n> So, with 12 days lost, how can you compute dates? For example, how can you compute the number of days between October 12, 1492, and July 4, 1776? Do you include those missing 12 days? To avoid having to solve this problem, the original Sybase SQL Server developers decided not to allow dates before 1753. You can store earlier dates by using character fields, but you can't use any datetime functions with the earlier dates that you store in character fields.\n\nThe choice of 1753 does seem somewhat anglocentric however as many catholic countries in Europe had been using the calendar for 170 years before the British implementation (originally delayed due to opposition by the church). Conversely many countries did not reform their calendars until much later, 1918 in Russia. Indeed the October Revolution of 1917 started on 7 November under the Gregorian calendar.\nBoth ```datetime``` and the new ```datetime2``` datatype mentioned in Joe's answer do not attempt to account for these local differences and simply use the Gregorian Calendar.\nSo with the greater range of ```datetime2```\n```SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DATEADD(DAY,-5,CAST('1752-09-13' AS DATETIME2)),100)\n```\nReturns\n```Sep  8 1752 12:00AM\n```\nOne final point with the ```datetime2``` data type is that it uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar projected backwards to well before it was actually invented so is of limited use in dealing with historic dates.\nThis contrasts with other Software implementations such as the Java Gregorian Calendar class which defaults to following the Julian Calendar for dates until October 4, 1582 then jumping to October 15, 1582 in the new Gregorian calendar. It correctly handles the Julian model of leap year before that date and the Gregorian model after that date. The cutover date may be changed by the caller by calling ```setGregorianChange()```. \nA fairly entertaining article discussing some more peculiarities with the adoption of the calendar can be found here.",

The wave theory of light is often a good approximation when we are looking at how light propagates, and the particle theory of light is often a good approximation when we are looking at how light interacts i.e. exchanges energy with something else.\n\nSo it isn't really possible to answer the question where the photon is in this explanation. In general if you're looking at a system, like the one in the video, where the wave theory is a good description of light you'll find the photon theory to be a poor description of light, and vice versa. The two ways of looking at light are complementary.",

Such unverified theories regarding pyramids are collectively known as pyramidology.\n\nCzechoslovakian Karel Drbal even patented a pyramid-shaped device specifically designed for razor blades. Among the specifications: \n\n  It is beneficial to leave a new blade in the pyramid one to two weeks before using it. It is essential to place it there immediately after the first shave, and not the old, dull one. But it is possible to use an old one, if it is properly resharpened. The blade placed using the method above is left unobstructed until the next shave. The west edge should always face west. It improves the sharpening effect.\n",

Usually, this is used to define class/module (\"static\") methods:\n```class String\n  class << self\n    def value_of obj\n      obj.to_s\n    end\n  end\nend\nString.value_of 42   # => \"42\"\n```\nThis can also be written as a shorthand:\n```class String\n  def self.value_of obj\n    obj.to_s\n  end\nend\n```\nOr even shorter:\n```def String.value_of obj\n  obj.to_s\nend\n```\n\nWhen inside a function definition, ```self``` refers to the object the function is being called with. In this case, ```class``` opens the singleton class for that object; one use of that is to implement a poor man's state machine:\n```class StateMachineExample\n  def process obj\n    process_hook obj\n  end\nprivate\n  def process_state_1 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_2\n    end\n  end\n  def process_state_2 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_1\n    end\n  end\n  # Set up initial state\n  alias process_hook process_state_1\nend\n```\nSo, in the example above, each instance of ```StateMachineExample``` has ```process_hook``` aliased to ```process_state_1```, but note how in the latter, it can redefine ```process_hook``` (for ```self``` only, not affecting other ```StateMachineExample``` instances) to ```process_state_2```.

Each roll of film costs several dollars and gives up to 36 images. Specialized rolls were more expensive and had fewer exposures. Then, if you did not do development yourself, you had to pay for development. Also prints. Even if you did your own, chemicals and papers were recurring costs. And there was the added expensive of creating a wet darkroom. In the end, the hobby was quite costly.\n\nWith digital photography, you pay nearly all costs up-front and it comes out much cheaper for anyone who is into the art and shoots regularly. A mid-range DSLR with good lens and memory can easily be obtained for less than $2500. Many entry level ones exist for under $1000. If you were to shoot 10,000 frames before both your camera and lens dies, it would cost you between 2.5&cent; to 10&cent; per frame. It is far far less than even just the film for each frame. Still most cameras have shutters rated to at least 100,000 frames and lenses last much longer than cameras. Even if you only captured 1000 images, you would have a better deal than with film photography. All digital cameras come with rechargeable batteries, good for 500-1000 shots-per-charge (for DSLRs) and can be charged at least 50-100 times before needing to be replaced. That means you actually will not use up the battery before you have taken full advantage of the better value of digital photography.\n\nMarket conditions are forcing the price of digital photography to increase. The loss of market share of compact and ultra-compact digital cameras to cellphones forced manufacturers to discontinue such products and concentrate on higher-end offering. While the number of unit sales of digital cameras has been declining, the average price is going up to compensate for reduced revenue. This trend is expected to continue for a while.",

And, once you have a plausible short section, you can extend it (for example, if you know that one of the plaintexts is \" na**\", you can go through the dictionary of all words that start with \"na\", use those as cribs, and see which makes the other plaintext make sense).\n\nIn addition, you can often deduce things directly from the bit pattern.  For example, if the messages are in ASCII, then one thing to note that bit 6 of letters is set, but bit 6 of spaces, numbers and (most) punctuation is clear; because spaces are far more common than numbers and punctuation, then that will give you a good guess of where spaces occur in the texts (albeit without telling you which message a specific space appears in).\n\nNow, if you have 11 messages all encrypted with the same pad (an \"11-time pad\"), things get even easier.  Obviously, you can grab a crib across one message, and check it against the other 10; if it makes all 10 make sense, then it is almost certainly accurate.  Even better, by using the observation that you can distinguish spaces from letters (again, by comparing bit 6), you can find where all the spaces appear in the messages; these all act like 1 character cribs, probably revealing virtually all the text of all the messages.",

Layout and entry are generally easier using LaTeX than some other sort of equation editor. \n* Consistent handling of intra-document references and bibliography. As of a couple of years ago the major WYSIWYG editors still had problems with re-numbering cross-references and bibliography items. This is never a problem with BibTeX or LaTeX. \n* Separation of content and style. In principle this means that you can write your document without caring how it is formatted, and at the end of the day wrap it in the style-file provided by the journal publisher before submission to conform to the house style. In practice some of the journal publishers demand special formatting commands that partially moots this process. Furthermore recent versions of Word and LibreOffice Writer, when properly used, should be able to keep track of various levels of section heading separate from the body text, and apply uniform styling to each level. The gap is somewhat closing. \n* Tables and illustrations. With PSTricks or TikZ, one can produce high quality illustrations within the document (though the learning curve is a bit steep there). And I've found LaTeX to be better at preparing complex tables. \n\nWYSIWYG (especially Word and Writer) is better at:\n\n* Collaborative editing. Without using an online site for collaborative LaTeX editing (such as ShareLaTeX), working collaboratively on a LaTeX file ideally requires some sort of separate revision control software. Word and Writer have very good comments/annotations and edit-tracking features. When a large number of authors are commenting on the writing of one file, this can be very useful. \n* Spell check. Admittedly most text editors one uses to edit TeX files also do spell check. But this is generally conveniently built into WYSIWYG editors. \n* Compatibility. Unless you work in mathematics, computer science, or physics (and sometimes even if you work in those fields), it is more likely that your collaborators will know what to do with a Word or Writer file than a LaTeX file. \n* Minimum barrier to entry. If you just care about getting the ideas down on paper, you can use a WYSIWYG editor just like a typewriter. Sure, it may be tedious to fix the formatting later on, compared to LaTeX where one need to first figure out how to setup a bare-minimum file before using, it may be an attractive point. \n\nA wash:\n\n* Most journals provide templates for both Word and LaTeX, so there's no real winner there. \n\nSuggestion: if you want to convince someone to start using LaTeX, start them out first in one of the WYSIWYG environments designed for LaTeX first (for example LyX). This will help somewhat to ameliorate the scary entry barrier. ",

They're also not good for driving into something very soft–between the hammer strikes there's no torque applied and the bit can actually rotate backwards. You can see this by holding the chuck with your hands while the driver is on; you'll feel the pulsing of the strikes but chuck won't actually rotate. Finally, some impact drivers don't have a clutch, which means you need to be very careful if you're driving something that could be over-tightened or broken by the high torque.\n\nBesides the higher torque, impact drivers have another huge advantage in that you don't have to hold them tightly to provide the torque.

    "input": "",
    "output": "Any font has built-in spacing determined by the “side bearing” of each character. In metal type, the side bearing is the physical right or left edge of the individual piece of type that determines its spacing from the characters on either side. Digital fonts mimic this in the basic design process.\n\n* “To kern” means to adjust the spacing between a pair of letters, numerals, punctuation, etc.  (properly “glyphs”) so that their spacing looks correct. The letters AV, for example, have to overlap in any usual typeface, otherwise at least one of them ends up looking lost and bewildered. Their kerning is tightened to snug them up to one another. An italic f will collide with a following question or quote mark in some fonts, so the kerning must be opened up from the default spacing.\n\nAn ancient scribe could kern effortlessly with pen and ink, and if you read old manuscripts you'll see lots of places where a letter intrudes into the space of the one next to it. With metal type, it wasn't so easy. Kerning required cutting away some of the metal base, or table, of the character. The amount of time, skill and work involved is left as an exercise for readers whose minds are in need of a little boggling. The shapes of the letters in metal type intended for long passages of text such as books, or especially newspapers, were designed to minimize the amount of kerning that would be necessary.\n\nKerning tables built into a digital font assign preset kerning values to specific letter pairs, according to the designer's best estimate of how they should look. There can be a dozen or so pairs (or none!) in a cheapo font, thousands in a high-end one. No matter how thoroughly and well a kerning table is built, though, there will still be situations where some awkward combination requires that the kerning be loosened or tightened from the preset values of the glyphs.\n\n* Letter spacing (often “tracking” in software applications) adjusts the spacing between all the glyphs in a piece of text. This can help to make a page look a little more open and inviting, for example, especially with a similarly open leading. Very large type, such as a big headline, almost always benefits from tightening the tracking. Tiny type, such as in captions or footnotes, is made more readable by opening the letter spacing a bit, especially if the paper is absorbent and will allow the ink to spread a little.\n\nA final note: Use caution with both kerning and tracking. Tracking is very often wildly overdone, kerning is seldom done enough.",

For example, 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with A4=440Hz is a standard in modern music. From those two parameters, we can extrapolate the exact frequency of every possible note.\n\n12TET is nearly ubiquitous nowadays (at least in Western music), but it doesn't sound as clean as Just Intonation (JI). In essence, 12TET has made every key sound equally imperfect. JI creates a scale where the intervals in the primary chords are all very nice simple ratios, and so the chords ring out very cleanly, but it only works in that key. Important note: within a given JI tuning, each of the 12 pitch classes still has only one single frequency. There is no difference between C♯ and D♭ in, say, \"Pythagorean tuning based on A, with A=440Hz\".\n\nBut most music doesn't stay in one key. While a piano can't make pitch adjustments on the fly (which is why we've agreed to use 12TET for it), most instruments in an orchestra can. So when the piece is in A major, the orchestra will use JI and adjust C♯ to be a little flatter than it would be if using 12TET. But then if the piece modulates to F♯ minor, they'll start playing it slightly sharp.\n\nWhen people say that C♯ is not the same as D♭, what they really mean (whether they realize it or not) is that context may make for different micro-adjustments. In C major, a C♯ might be the third of an A major chord, perhaps a secondary dominant of the ii chord, while D♭ might be the root of the Neapolitan chord.

When used as an encryption key, a non-statistically random key may expose weaknesses in the encryption function.\n* To fit the keys to the encryption key length. Most passwords are going to be either longer or shorter than the key space of the encryption function. By hashing your password, the exact key length will be exactly the size of the input key of your encryption function. While the entropy of the derived key doesn't increase, this avoids the likelihood of exposing weakness in the encryption function if you just simply zero pad the password or worse truncate the password.\n* To slow down key derivation decryption. Per your description, the software is only using a single SHA256 round, which is not much. But with proper password based KDF, like PBKDF2, there are usually tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of rounds of the underlying hash function. This slows down computing the keys, increasing the effective strength of passwords without increasing its length.\n* To keep the user's plain text password out of memory, thus preventing it from being accidentally dumped to disk during hibernation or crash dump.

This then affects how other Views are laid out around the ImageView.\n\nThen as Samuh wrote, you can change the way it default scales images using the ```android:scaleType``` parameter. \n\nBy the way, the easiest way to discover how this works would simply have been to experiment a bit yourself! Just remember to look at the layouts in the emulator itself (or an actual phone) as the preview in Eclipse is usually wrong.\n\n",

A ```pull``` effectively runs ```git fetch``` and then ```git merge``` so a merge is usually happening when you run ```git pull```.\n\nThe alternative to use rebasing instead of merging is possible, but usually you should avoid it. Rebasing allows you to keep a linear history, but also removes any information about the branching that originally happened. It will also cause the history of the current branch being rewritten, recreating all commits that are not contained in the target branch (in your case, the remote). As the recreated commits are different commits, this can cause a lot of confusion when developing together with others, especially when people already checked out parts of those commits before they get rewritten (for example with feature branches). So as a rule of thumb, you should never rewrite any commit that was already pushed.\n\nThe commits you see are there to combine two (or more) branches. It is perfectly fine to have a commit that does nothing else then merging multiple branches. In fact it makes it very clear when you have a merge commit that combines branches when looking at the history. In comparison to rebasing, merging also allows you to effectively see the original history as it was developed, including the actual branches that coexisted.\n\nSo, long story short: Yes, having merge commits is perfectly fine and you should not worry about them.",

It is a famous alpine rock route, not just in Washington, but nationally. First ascended by John Rupley & Don Gordon (1956) [Great Gendarme] and James Wickwire & Fred Stanley (1964), it's a must-do for alpine rock enthusiasts.\n\nRoute Overview:\nFrom the Stuart Glacier notch, approximately 11 pitches of low/mid 5th class climbing lead to the Gendarme's base. Despite the enjoyable exposed climbing, the Gendarme features the most remarkable pitches. Two crux 5.9 pitches await, with the first being a steep dihedral offering good rests between challenging sections. Traverse to the offwidth, power through it, and tackle one more 5.8-5.9 pitch before the final three pitches of low 5th.\n\nEquipment:\nGear preferences vary. Carry your usual equipment for long alpine rock routes. If you want extra security in the cruxy 5.9 offwidth, carry one 3.5\" piece. You may need an ice axe and crampons if you approach via the glacier. \n\nGetting there:\nDrive I-90 to exit 85, turn left to join SR-970. Drive 6.6 mi and turn left on Teanaway River Road. Follow north fork road approximately 23 mil to the end of road.\n\nApproach and Descends:\nMultiple approach options exist, each with pros and cons. Either approach from the south via Longs Pass TH or from the north via Mountaineer Creek. Acquire a topographic map to determine the best route. If approaching from LPTH, head to Ingalls Lake, traverse ledges around the lake's east side, follow the trail to Stuart Pass, and descend northwest on talus. Ascend more talus to Goat Pass, traverse Stuart Glacier, and reach the 4th class gully leading to the North Ridge's prominent notch, marking the beginning of the upper ridge. If descending via LPTH, head down from the summit towards the false summit via blocky terrain, follow cairns and a ledge system east, and descend the seemingly endless Cascadian Couloir, eventually reaching Ingalls Creek.\nScramble to the false summit. Descend steep snow or scree then keep right through sparse trees to enter the Cascadian Couloir. Descend all the way  to the valley floor, and then you can go back to via Long’s peak or Ingalls Lake. \n\nThis route is incredible and a must-do for anyone at ease with alpine rock climbing at this level.

    "output": "Michael Jordan and LeBron James are widely considered to be two of the greatest basketball players of all time, with both having accomplished a significant amount in their careers. However, the evaluation of their achievements is open to personal interpretation, and there is no clear consensus on which one is superior.

    "input": "",
    "output": "Democracies come in various shapes and sizes. One way of classifying democracies is into presidential, semi-presidential, and parliamentary democracies. The key differences lie in the checks and balances between the executive branch (the government) and the legislative branch (the legislature):\n\n*  In a presidential democracy, the government is not responsible to the legislature, i.e. it cannot be removed by a vote of no-confidence. For example, in the United States, the president is elected separately from Congress, and cannot be removed by congress during their term, apart from extreme circumstances (impeachment and conviction).\n\n*  In a semi-presidential democracy, the head of state is elected independently of the legislature, and is not responsible to the legislature, but the government is. For example, France is a semi-presidential democracy, where the president is elected directly by the citizens, but the government and prime minister are voted in by the parliament.\n\n*  In a parliamentary democracy, the government is responsible to the legislature, aligning the executive and legislative branches. Many parliamentary democracies elect their head of state via the legislature, while others, such as the United Kingdom, have a hereditary head of state.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Learning a foreign language is an important skill that can open up countless opportunities and experiences. Whether for travel, work, or personal growth, knowing how to speak a second or third language is a valuable asset in today’s increasingly globalized world. While it may sometimes seem like a daunting undertaking, there are several key strategies that can help make learning a new language easier and more effective.\n\nOne of the first steps in learning a foreign language is to set a goal. This could be something as simple as learning a few key phrases before a trip abroad or something more long term, such as achieving fluency in a language for work or personal reasons. Setting a goal provides a clear endpoint and motivation to keep going.\n\nOnce a goal has been established, it’s important to create a structured learning plan. This can include setting aside dedicated study time each day or week, focusing on specific aspects of the language (such as grammar or vocabulary), and setting measurable benchmarks to track progress. A learning plan keeps things organized and ensures that steady progress is being made toward the ultimate goal.\n\nImmersion is one of the best ways to learn a foreign language quickly and effectively. This can involve watching movies without subtitles, reading books in the target language, listening to podcasts, or even taking a trip to a foreign country. Immersive learning helps build confidence speaking the language and exposes learners to new words and concepts in a natural way.\n\nPracticing regularly is essential when learning a foreign language. This can take many forms, including talking to native speakers, practicing with flashcards, using online programs, or simply thinking in the target language. Practice reinforces what has already been learned and helps develop new skills. It also builds confidence, which is crucial for improving language ability.\n\nIt’s important to remember that learning a foreign language takes time and practice. Don’t get discouraged if progress seems slow - every little bit counts! With dedication and perseverance, anyone can become multilingual.",

    "instruction": "Here are a few paragraphs that I took out of Wikipedia:\n* The Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the Mario series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the New Super Mario Bros. series). In early Mario games such as Super Mario Bros., special, well-hidden areas known as Warp Zones contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.[19] In the New Super Mario Bros. series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. Cannons appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with Super Mario 64. The character uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming themself and being fired at a distant target. This allows the character to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n* Much of the supporting cast was introduced in the succeeding games for the Genesis and its add-ons. Sonic 2 introduced Sonic's sidekick Miles \"Tails\" Prower, a fox who can fly using his two tails.[208] Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose, a pink hedgehog and Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend, and Metal Sonic, a robotic doppelgänger of Sonic created by Eggman.[209] Sonic 3 introduced Sonic's rival Knuckles, a red echidna and the guardian of the Master Emerald.[210] The Master Emerald, introduced in Sonic & Knuckles,[211] controls the power of the Chaos Emeralds.[201] Knuckles' Chaotix introduced the Chaotix, a group comprising Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee.[212] A number of characters introduced during this period, such as Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel from SegaSonic the Hedgehog and Fang the Sniper from Sonic Triple Trouble (1994), faded into obscurity, although they sometimes reappear.[38][213]\n* Some Easter eggs originated from in-jokes between members of the development team. One example is \"Toasty\", which found its way into the game in the form of a small image of sound designer Dan Forden, who would appear in the corner of the screen during gameplay (after performing an uppercut) and yell the phrase \"Toasty!\", originating from him saying \"you're toast\".[45] This egg was also the key to unlocking the hidden character Smoke when it happened in the Portal stage in Mortal Kombat II.[42] In Mortal Kombat 4, Forden would say \"Toasty! 3D!\" after Scorpion did his burn Fatality, a reference to the fact that it is the first 3D game of the series.[46] \"Toasty!\" is also found in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, appearing randomly after the character pulls off a chain of hits, though the picture of Forden was removed for that title,[47] but brought back for the 2011 Mortal Kombat game. Yet another private joke was the hidden character Noob Saibot, who has appeared in various versions of the game starting with Mortal Kombat II. The character's name derived from two of the series' creators' surnames, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards.[48] In addition, a counter for ERMACS on the game's audits screen (ERMACS being short for error macros), was interpreted by some players as a reference to a hidden character in the original Mortal Kombat. The development team decided to turn the rumor into reality, introducing Ermac in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 as an unlockable secret character.[49][50] The hidden character Mokap, introduced in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, is a tribute to Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in MK and MKII and has served as a motion capture actor for subsequent titles in the series.[51]\n\nWrite 10 quiz questions based on the information in these paragraphs.",

    "output": "If the internet had never been invented, the world would be a very different place.\nThe most immediate difference would be a much slower pace of technological development. The internet allows ideas to be shared instantly, and for collaboration between individuals who may be thousands of miles apart. It allows companies to outsource work to people all over the world, and for people to find information and learn new things at incredible speeds.\nWithout the internet, all of these things would be much slower. It would take years for a new idea to spread around the world, for example, and companies would have to rely on people local to their business for all of their workforce.\nThe world would also be a much less connected place. It's easy to forget, as the internet has become such a huge part of our lives, that it's really only been around for a couple of decades. Before then, it was still possible to travel and communicate internationally, but it was much more difficult, and as a result, the world was a much bigger place.\nWithout the internet, we would see more regional cultures and identities. In a world where it takes years for new ideas to spread, cultures have a much better chance to grow and flourish independently.\nWe would also see a much bigger difference between rich and poor countries. The internet has allowed developing countries to leapfrog in many areas of technology, for example in the way that many people in Africa have skipped landline phone networks and gone straight to mobile phones. Without the internet, these kinds of leapfrogging effects would be much less common.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "To tell if someone if being truthful or lying to you, here are a few things to look for:\n\n* Look for inconsistencies in what they say. If one time they said one thing, and another time they said the opposite, or if they contradict themselves within the same conversation, that's a sign that they may be lying. \n\n* Look for signs of stress. Liars often have a harder time lying when they're under more stress. Pay attention to whether or not they seem nervous. Are they fidgeting? Stuttering? Avoiding eye contact? These can all be signs that they're lying to you. However, some people are good liars, and can lie with a straight face. This is why it's best to look for multiple signs that they're lying.\n\n* Pay attention to what they don't say. If someone is lying to you, they may leave out details, or fail to correct you when you make an assumption that isn't true. \n\n* Ask follow-up questions. Liars often give short answers because they're trying to avoid giving details that may incriminate them. Follow up with questions like, \"Why did you do that?\" or \"How did that happen?\" to see if they're fumbling for an answer.\n\n* Ask questions you already know the answer to. This is a great way to catch someone in a lie. If you know the answer, you can say, \"Oh, so it was you who broke the vase, not Kyle,\" and see if they correct you.\n\n* Look for micro-expressions. A micro-expression is a brief, involuntary facial expression that reveals someone's true emotions. People who are lying may make a micro-expression of anxiety or guilt. You have to pay close attention, because these expressions only last for a fraction of a second.\n\n* Pay attention if they change the subject. This is a classic sign of a liar. If someone is trying to distract you from the truth, they may change the subject or try to redirect the conversation.\n\nAnd remember, people lie for many reasons. The simple fact that someone is lying to you does not mean that they are guilty of the crime you are investigating. They may be protecting someone else, or themselves from something embarrassing, or they may be lying about something completely unrelated. Always keep the reason for your questioning in mind, and be prepared to pursue other lines of inquiry based on the information you learn.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "It's never too late to learn the piano. However, it will be harder for you than for a child:\n\n* You have to make a conscious decision to practice, whereas a child just does it because their parents told them to. This makes it easier to skip practice when you don't feel like it.\n* You probably have other responsibilities (work, family) that take up time and energy. A child usually has nothing but time and energy. This means you'll have to be more efficient in your practice, and cut out all non-essential activities.\n* You're starting from zero. A child can learn a piece of music in a few days that would take you months to learn. This means you have to be patient and accept that you'll be playing nursery rhymes for a while.\n\nOn the other hand, you have some advantages over a child:\n\n* You can understand more abstract concepts. This means you can learn more efficiently, and don't have to rely on muscle memory as much.\n* You have a greater capacity for focused concentration. A child's attention span is very short. This means you can get more done in a single practice session.\n* You have a better sense of dedication and perseverance. A child will give up the moment it becomes difficult. You, on the other hand, will stubbornly keep trying until you succeed. This will get you through the initial stages much faster.\n\nThe conclusion is that it's not too late for you to learn the piano, but it will take a lot of effort and discipline. If you're willing to put in the work, you will succeed.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "If Ming dynasty China had crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas during the 15th century, history as we know it would have been dramatically altered. Here is one speculation of how such a scenario might have unfolded and its potential repercussions up to the present day.\n\nReal History: In the early 1400s, the Ming dynasty, under Emperor Yongle, carried out ambitious naval expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He, who explored and established trade relations across the Indian Ocean and as far west as Africa.\n\nHypothetical Scenario: In this alternate history, Zheng He's fleet ventures further eastward, crossing the Pacific Ocean and reaching present-day California.\n\nHow does this scenario play out?\n\n* Upon discovering the Americas, the Chinese encounter indigenous civilizations and establish trading relations with them. This leads to the establishment of Chinese settlements along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Chinese settlers import advanced technologies, including gunpowder, paper, printing, and agricultural practices, transforming the lives of indigenous peoples. At the same time, the introduction of Old World diseases decimates indigenous populations, akin to the Columbian exchange in our timeline.\n\n* Over the 1500s and 1600s, hybrid Chinese-indigenous societies form throughout the Americas, forming unique cultures, languages, and religions. The trans-Pacific trade between China and its colonies sparks an economic golden age in China, making it the richest empire on Earth. By reinvesting its newfound wealth in its military, the Ming dynasty does not collapse as in our timeline, instead becoming the number one naval power in the world.\n\n* In parallel, Europeans do eventually arrive in the Americas and settle parts of the Atlantic coast. Contact between Chinese and European colonies, particularly in Central America, ignites a series of local conflicts, culminating in an acknowledgement of Chinese sovereignty over modern-day Mexico in exchange for civil and cultural rights for indigenous peoples and European settlers, enforced through a non-interventionist policy of the Chinese colonial government. By creating the world’s first de facto multicultural territory, this agreement facilitates a steady flow of goods, technologies, and ideas between Chinese, European, and indigenous cultures, influencing humanistic ideologies that spread throughout the New World.\n\n* Throughout the 1700s and 1800s, a unique American identity emerges from the multicultural melting pot, based on universal humanist values. This new generation of Americans finds itself at odds with Old World notions of national identity and monarchy, and eventually rebel against Chinese, European, and other external influences. Some colonies gain independence during this period, while other territories are annexed by the newly-independent American countries over the following century.\n\n* By the present day, the American continents host nations that are independent of their original Old World colonies, much like in our timeline, though they differ in geographical borders and ethno-cultural composition. China is more powerful and prosperous in this timeline, having benefited from its American colonies for three centuries.\n\nTo conclude, had Ming dynasty China crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas in the 15th century, history would have been significantly different. It is important to remember that the scenario presented here is purely hypothetical, and that the actual historical events followed a different path, with European powers ultimately dominating the colonization of the New World.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Handedness is a very interesting phenomenon, but it is not as simple as being either left or right handed.\nIn most people the brain is asymmetrical, with some functions, such as language, being localised to one hemisphere. In most people this is the left hemisphere, which leads to these people being right handed as they use their dominant hand to perform tasks involving fine motor control, such as writing. Left handed people have their language centres in the right hemisphere, and while they may perform other tasks with their left hand they can often do tasks involving fine motor control with either hand.\nThere are also people who are truly ambidextrous, capable of performing tasks with either hand equally well. These people, while rare, do not have brains that are symmetrical, but have developed connections between the two hemispheres that allow them to access both motor cortices.\nThe genetics of handedness are complex and not well understood. There does appear to be a genetic component, but it is not straightforward. Identical twins who are brought up in the same environment are not always both left or right handed, suggesting that environmental factors also play a role.\nOne of the most interesting things about handedness is how early it becomes apparent. Children as young as two years old can be assessed for handedness, and it is very rare for a child's handedness to change over time. This suggests that it is very strongly influenced by genetics, with environmental factors playing a minor role.",

A number of, as yet unproven, hypotheses are suggested for why it might occur, including: delay in the maturity of the central nervous system, increased slow wave sleep, sleep deprivation, fever, and excessive tiredness. There may be a genetic component to sleepwalking. One study found that sleepwalking occurred in 45% of children who have one parent who sleepwalked, and in 60% of children if both parents sleepwalked. Thus, heritable factors may predispose an individual to sleepwalking, but expression of the behavior may also be influenced by environmental factors.\n\nSleepwalking has been hypothesized to be linked to the neurotransmitter serotonin, which also appears to be metabolized differently in migraine patients and people with Tourette syndrome, both populations being four to nine times more likely to experience an episode of sleepwalking. Hormonal fluctuations have been found to contribute to sleepwalking episodes in women, with the likeliness to sleepwalk being higher before the onset of menstruation.

In addition to the main conference sessions, the conference will also include Expo, Tutorials, and Workshops. Please submit proposals to the appropriate chairs.\n\nWe invite submissions of papers on all topics related to machine learning for the main conference proceedings. All papers will be reviewed in a double-blind process and accepted papers will be presented at the conference. As with last year, papers need to be prepared and submitted as a single file: 8 pages as main paper, with unlimited pages for references and appendix. There will be no separate deadline for the submission of supplementary material. In addition, we require that, barring exceptional circumstances (such as visa problems) upon the acceptance of their papers, at least one of the authors must attend the conference, in person.\n\nTopics of interest include (but are not limited to):\n\n* General Machine Learning (active learning, clustering, online learning, ranking, reinforcement learning, supervised, semi- and self-supervised learning, time series analysis, etc.)\n* Deep Learning (architectures, generative models, deep reinforcement learning, etc.)\n* Learning Theory (bandits, game theory, statistical learning theory, etc.)\n* Optimization (convex and non-convex optimization, matrix/tensor methods, stochastic, online, non-smooth, composite, etc.)\n* Probabilistic Inference (Bayesian methods, graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, etc.)\n* Trustworthy Machine Learning (accountability, causality, fairness, privacy, robustness, etc.)\n* Applications (computational biology, crowdsourcing, healthcare, neuroscience, social good, climate science, etc.)\n\nImportant Dates:\n\nSubmission deadline: [Date and Time].\nNotification of acceptance: [Date and Time].\nConference dates: [Date and Time].\n\nSubmission Guidelines:\n\nDouble-Blind Review:\nAll submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing policy, including (but not limited to) citing previous works of the authors or sharing links in a way that can infer any author’s identity or institution, actions that reveal the identities of the authors to potential reviewers.\n\nAuthors are allowed to post versions of their work on preprint servers such as arXiv. They are also allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to ICML during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the ICML decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version.\n\nICML strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media or in the press while under submission to ICML. Under no circumstances should your work be explicitly identified as ICML submission at any time during the review period, i.e., from the time you submit the paper to the communication of the accept/reject decisions.\n\nDual Submission:\nIt is not appropriate to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy, and the organizers have the right to reject such submissions, or to remove them from the proceedings. Note that submissions that have been or are being presented at workshops do not violate the dual-submission policy, as long as there’s no associated archival publication.\n\nReviewing Criteria:\nAccepted papers must be based on original research and must contain novel results of significant interest to the machine learning community. Results can be either theoretical or empirical. Results will be judged on the degree to which they have been objectively established and/or their potential for scientific and technological impact. Reproducibility of results and easy availability of code will be taken into account in the decision-making process whenever appropriate.",

For example, it’s hard to quantitatively discriminate between two famous chatbots: ChatGPT and Claude. Therefore, we really need an evaluation tool that can help us automate the characterization of generative AI systems.\nChateval has two main functions that can assist with the development and evaluation of generative AI systems.\n*  Support comprehensive evaluation suits: Chateval provides more than 50 different evaluation scenarios, ranging from copywriting, coding, math and safety detection. Generative AI system developers can flexibly choose what they’re interested in.\n* Support rich evaluation metrics: Chateval provides a wealth of metrics that can be used to evaluate generated texts from different criteria, such as helpfulness, relevance, factuality etc.\n\n[Goals]\nDevelop an evaluation tool for generative AI so that both developers and general users can benefit from it.\n\n[Use Cases]\nThere are several potential use scenarios for Chateval:\n\n# Reveal Limitations of Generative AI systems\nChateval can be particularly valuable to developers who are working on an AI system but are uncertain of its weaknesses. With the aid of Chateval, these developers can swiftly pinpoint the system's flaws and suggest the appropriate corrective measures.\n\n# Provide Reliability Score for Users\nChateval can be utilized by users who are uncertain about the reliability (e.g. factuality) of the output generated by a generative AI product. It can offer confidence scores for various functionalities to assess the credibility of the results.\n\n[API Design]\nThis is a basic design of the API for evaluation:\n# Evaluate in terms of write_email scenario\n```\nfrom chateval import load\nscenario = load(\"../scenarios/write_email\")\npredictions = [\n    \"My name is [name], and I am currently a student in your [class name].\",\n]\nprint(scenario.evaluate(predictions))\n```\n# Evaluate Single System with Chateval Metric\n```\nfrom chateval.metrics import get_metric\ndataset = [{\"input\": \"write a movie review of Titanic\"}]\npredictions = [\n    'James Cameron\\'s 1997 epic romantic disaster film \"Titanic\" tells the '\n]\nmetric = get_metric(\"generic_likert/helpfulness\")\nresults = metric.compute(dataset, predictions)\nprint(results)\n\n```\n[Milestones]\n* 1 month: Implement crowdsourable framework for Chateval\n* 1 week: Collect benchmark datasets for evaluation scenarios\n* 2 weeks: Implement model-based and model-free evaluation metrics\n* 2 - 3 weeks: Use Chateval to evaluate existing popular chatbots\n\n[Open Questions]\n* How to design a user-friendly interface?\n* How to support more diverse chatbots\n\n[People]\n* [Name 1]\n* [Name 2]\n* [Name 3]",

Intentionally leave out a few missing positive and negative numbers, but include 0 at the center.\n* Ask students to identify the missing numbers on the number line and write down on a sheet of paper.\n* Ask one or two students to come up to the board to write the missing numbers.\n* Select a point on the number line and ask a student to come up and show the opposite of that number on the line.\n\n###Teacher Instruction (10 minutes):\n* Show that opposites are the same distance from zero, but in different directions. Demonstrate with the opposites that the students labeled on the number line earlier.\n* Define the absolute value of a number as its distance from zero. Let students find the absolute values of the two opposites from the introduction.\n* Plot another point on the original number line. Ask students to find the absolute value of that number. Let one student explain their answer to the class.\n* Ask students if they notice a pattern about absolute value. Students should notice that absolute value is always positive.\n* Tell students that absolute value is also helpful for understanding real-world situations. Use an elevator example with the ground floor marked as zero. Ask students to measure the distance between underground or overground floors to the ground floor.\n\n###Guided Practice (10 minutes):\n* Provide students with an introductory absolute value worksheet. The worksheet should be as simple as possible.\n* Have students pair with partners to complete this worksheet. Check in on students while they work.\n\n###Independent Work (20 minutes)\n* Provide students with an absolute value word problems worksheet. This worksheet should help students connect absolute value to real-life situations.\n* Have students work independently on these word problems.\n\n###Assessment (10 minutes):\n* Ask students to find the absolute value of some numbers (e.g. -6, -3.5, 17) on a sheet of paper.\n* Write the temperatures -6°C, 1°C, and -3°C on the board. Ask students which is coldest.\n* Collect the students' answers to measure how well students understood this lesson.\n\n###Conclusion (5 minutes)\n* Let a student explain their answer to the temperature problem.\n* Ask students to define absolute value to their partner.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "It is important to understand that there is no \"one size fits all\" answer to your question. Every relationship is different, and there is no single way to define a \"healthy\" relationship.\n\nThat said, there are some general guidelines that you can use. One of the most important things to remember is that a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being yourself, and you should feel that your partner respects and values you as a person.\n\nAnother important aspect of a healthy relationship is honesty. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being open and honest with your partner. Your partner should feel the same way towards you. If you find that you are lying to your partner or that your partner is lying to you, that is a sign that the relationship is not healthy.\n\nIn addition, equality is also an important aspect of a healthy relationship. In a healthy relationship, neither partner should feel that they are \"superior\" to the other, and neither should feel like they are \"inferior\". The relationship should be equal in every way.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that a healthy relationship takes work. You shouldn't expect a healthy relationship to be perfect. You will have arguments and disagreements just like any other couple, but how you deal with those disagreements is what makes the relationship healthy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to know if your relationship is healthy is to ask yourself if you feel comfortable being yourself around your partner, if you feel like your partner respects you, if you feel like your partner is honest with you, if you feel like your partner is equal to you, and if you feel like you can talk to your partner about anything. If you can answer yes to all of those questions, then your relationship is probably healthy.",

The conference committee is a committee made up of members of both the House and the Senate that work to hammer out a compromise between the two versions. Once a compromise is reached, the conference committee reports the compromise back to their respective houses. If both houses pass the conference committee report, it goes to the president for signature. If not, it is dead.\nNote that this is a very simplified description of the process. There are many procedural hurdles in both houses that can derail a bill even before it gets to conference committee.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Here are some suggestions to improve your public speaking skills.\n\nThe first thing you must do is to accept that it's normal to be nervous. Even the most seasoned public speakers still get nervous before giving a big presentation. The difference is that they have learned to control their nervousness and even use it to their advantage.\n\nSecond, you need to realize that people aren't actually out to judge and criticize you. They actually want you to be good. They want to be entertained, informed, enlightened - whatever the goal of your speech is, they want you to achieve it. When you give a speech, you and the audience have the same goal - for you to be good. So don't think that people are out to get you.\n\nThird, what you must do is to practice, practice, practice. There is no substitute for this. When you first start out, you'll be nervous even when giving a speech in front of just one other person. That's fine. Just keep practicing and you'll get better.\n\nLast, you need to learn the art of storytelling. This is a powerful technique that will help you engage your audience and keep them interested in what you have to say. Stories are powerful because everyone likes to hear stories. Even if your speech has nothing to do with stories, you can still use storytelling techniques to make it more interesting. For example, you can start your speech by telling a brief story about something relevant to your speech. Or you can use stories as illustrations or examples when explaining points in your speech.",

The research proposal should be about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models, and to do so using instructions (in natural language). Let's start by drafting an abstract and an introduction.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Here is the abstract and introduction of a research proposal about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models:\n\n\n#Controlling Biases in Large Language Models\n\n\n##Abstract\n\nWhile large language models are unlocking previously unimaginable applications, their extensive usage also exacerbates the risk of generating toxic text that amplifies adverse biases in the training data. We propose utilizing the newfound instruction understanding abilities of large language models to identify, explain, and mitigate undesirable biases in text. Our research plan begins with a novel method for eliciting natural language explanations of why a particular text is harmful, without any training data or definition of what constitutes toxic text. We then propose to investigate whether explicitly instructing models to avoid biases using natural language prompts can steer them away from unwanted outputs. Finally, we aim to explore a more permanent solution by fine-tuning the model on anti-harm instructions (behavioral guidelines, codes of conduct, diversity training), and thus informing it on which utterances should be avoided. Successfully tuning large language models to better align with acceptable behavior will dramatically advance the ability to deploy safer, fairer models in real-world settings.\n\n\n##Introduction\n\nLanguage models, the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP), are known to reflect and even amplify biases in training corpora, often resulting in racist, sexist, and generally toxic outputs. Susceptibility to such harmful biases hinders the deployment of these models and limits their applicability.\n\nA common approach for developing safer models is to try to control the training corpora. [Citations], for example, used a list of banned words to filter potentially harmful text from the C4 corpus. This simple approach fails to remove all adverse biases from the text, as toxic content can be written using words that are, by themselves, benign. Another technique for corpus intervention is data augmentation [Citations], which adds a counterfactual example for each utterance of a potentially biased text. This technique, however, only applies when counterfactual swaps are possible, e.g. gender, and it requires prior knowledge of all potential biases in the training corpus. Data augmentation enlarges an already oversized corpus, and can often create artificial and even unrealistic texts if not done carefully. Finally, various approaches perform post-training debiasing [Citations], but these often result in significant performance degradation on downstream tasks.\n\nWe propose explaining and mitigating adverse biases via natural language instructions. Our plan includes three parts:\n*  Inducing natural language explanations of adverse biases in a given text. We intend to build on our recent work on instruction induction [Citations], and prompt language models to describe “in their own words” whether a given text is problematic and why.\n*  Controlling the manifestation of model biases during generation by prompting language models with explicit instructions. We plan to investigate the use of both model-generated explanations and existing guidelines written for humans (e.g. code of conduct) to reduce and control adverse biases during inference.\n*  Mitigating adverse biases in the model itself by fine-tuning on behavioral guidelines. The goal is to efficiently adapt the model itself so that it (permanently) generates less harmful content. We build on recent work which shows that fine-tuning on task instructions (instruction tuning) improves the zero-shot learning abilities of language models [Citations]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has utilized this framework for teaching models what behaviors should be avoided. The success of instruction tuning suggests that our approach is viable, and we hope it can accelerate the progress towards safer, fairer models.",
